The tablets I will use are running Android 3.2 system.I saw a couple of options to achieve that on rooted devices, but, then I saw that some applications have managed to lock the bottom bar without rooting the device first. For example \"MX Player\" application on android market.Could someone point me to the right direction please?Thanks in advance, Danny",
