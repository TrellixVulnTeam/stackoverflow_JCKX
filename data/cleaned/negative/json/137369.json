    "Body":"I've been reading the news in the US about a court order for Apple to help the FBI bypass the security check present on devices running iOS8+. Since iOS8, Apple has stopped storing encryption keys on the cloud.I'm just wondering how does this apply to Android. I believe Nexus devices that came with Marshmallow out of the box (6P and 5x) have full disk encryption thus these will have the same security as iOS8+ devices.How about those that were upgrade to Marshmallow? I know my G3 was upgraded to Marshmallow but encryption is turned off. Also, does turning it on make a difference? Or perhaps the 6P and 5x has extra hardware so encryption keys aren't stored in the cloud?Thanks for reading and your replies :)",
