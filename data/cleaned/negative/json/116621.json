    "Body":"I recently did a factory reset on my Motorola X - 2nd Generation Phone.  The problem is that I had several voice files that are actually important as they are part of a Book Publishing to be published soon.  I just need some direction as to if there is an effective way out there that can recover the actual folders\/files from an Android that was essentially wiped.  I am hitting over my head right now as I am really disciplined when it comes to backing up my data on my Laptop but now realize I have to be the same with my Smartphones if I have important data on there. Any suggestions or advice here?",
