    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Google play fails to install application with RPC:S-5:AEC-0  I recently bought 2 of these tablets, which had good reviews. I bought them for my young daughters for Christmas. So, the tablets didn't have to be the best in the market. They need to be able to download games, but I am having problems with downloading from the Play Store.The most frequent error is the RPC:S-5:AEC-0 error. All the fixes I have found for this are for problems following updates, and not for brand new devices. Nevertheless, I have tried clearing caches, re-installing GMail accounts, and restoring to factory settings but nothing is working.The above link shows that the devices are on 4.0.3. But when I checked the tablets, they are on 4.0.4.Any ideas?",
