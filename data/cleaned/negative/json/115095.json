    "Body":"I know similar question is floating on the same site, but no solution works for me.I have been using Karbonn A26 Smart phone for the last two years, and I was not able to install run YouTube and Google+ since 2 years. Its hardware is quite ok. It runs Android 4.1.1.Let me be clear what I am doing:When I install and open YouTube, it says YouTube cannot work without Google Play Services. When I click on Get Play Services, it gives me error: \"Incompatible with other applications(s) using the same shared user ID\".So I factory reset the phone. Then I try it out, same. I can download and install YouTube, but when open it, it keeps saying same \"Cannot play without Play Services\".Same thing happens when I install and run Google+.Installing YouTube on clean OS itself does not work.Do I need to wipe cache? I think factory resetting must also wipe cache. What should I do to resolve this issue?",
