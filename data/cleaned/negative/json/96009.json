It will say the internal storage is running out but when I check the storage use it will say:Total space 1.97 GBAvailable: 182MBApps: 622 MBCached 11.70 MBThis time, I checked my android\/data folder and it said Spotify was using 1GB of space (in addition to all the space it is using in my other storage), so I deleted the Spotify cache and uninstalled it, then wiped my cache in recovery, but I didn't end up with any extra space afterwards.I've deleted the log and LOST.DIR folders. I can't seem to free up any more space. Every time this happens I have to factory reset and reinstall cyanogen (I'm running CM 10.1.3 now) to recover storage space, but each time it happens again eventually. I tried updating to a newer version of CM 10.1.3 but that doesn't help either.UPDATE: I went through my apps to see if there was data I could get rid of there. I found 268MB in my Twitter app cache, but when I tried to clear the cache it wouldn't move. I uninstalled twitter but it didn't free up any storage space...What am I doing wrong?(Thanks!)",
