In order to verify\/restore applications I need to type my password.I need to extract a backup outside of TB, specifically I want to run an application on the emulator (where I couldn't install TB itself). The idea is simple: unzip data directory from phone backup and push it to device's `\/data\/data\/com.app` directory.The problem is that Linux won't read the encrypted `.tar.gz` file. AFAIK TB uses asymmetric cryptography, which I don't know being supported by Linux file managers (or Ark application).The question is: how do I extract an encrypted Titanium backup in Linux?Some people may argue: why don't you just `pull` data directory from phone and `push` it to the emulator? I tried, but the app refuses to start being unable to open its SQLite DB. I didn't write that app, but it's probably because I pulled a DB with open handlers. TB surely restores backup correctly."
