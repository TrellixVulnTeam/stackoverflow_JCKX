    "Body":"This is a newbie question. While travelling, I need to recharge my Galaxy Nexus and my digital camera, both of which are meant to be charged through a micro-USB port, ie. 0,5A.To reduce charging time, I have an 1A AC adaptor but it only has a single USB port.Google shows a number of two-port AC adaptors:one port is 1A, the other is 2,1A (it looks like Apple devices expect 2,1A)this one delivers 2A when using a single port, but 1A when using both portsIn case I only need to charge a single device, is it safe to have it fed 2 or 2,1A? I read that a device only uses the intensity it needs, but will it fry if it's fed too much intensity?Thank you.",
