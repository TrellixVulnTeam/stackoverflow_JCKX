I desire an program that remotely either plays my hard drive resident songs randomly or allows me to set up a play list. There are probably a million ways to do similar things using other techniques, but:I want the files to be physically on my laptop's hard drive and Accessible remotely (a resident program running on the laptop is OK).",
