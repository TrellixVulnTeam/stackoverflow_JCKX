    "Body":"I've been thinking about getting a pre-owned Samsung Fascinate from Verizon for $40. I can't afford a $30\/month unlimited data plan, but I was considering the $15\/month 150MB data plan.I'm planning on using it primarily as a phone\/PMP, without heavy use of internet-related features. Most of my data usage will probably come from these things:Downloading appsOccassionally checking weather, maps, etc.Texting through Google Voice. I plan all cancelling my texting plan and moving all my texting activities to Google Voice. I only use around ~300 texts (sent and received) per month.Is it reasonable to expect these activities to remain within 150MB\/month? On a related note, I am usually on my university's campus, which has wi-fi. Can I use the wi-fi network to avoid suffering data charges?Update: Verizon ran a promotion this weekend. For upgrading to a smartphone with unlimited data plan, you got a $10\/month credit for the next 24 months. So the $30\/unlimited data plan effectively becomes $20\/unlimited, and I went with that instead of the $15\/150MB plan.",
