I have not backed up any of my files, unfortunately. A user on here gave me the idea to salvage my media content via copying my SD Card's contents to my PC, then copying these files to a new card and placing the new card in my phone - thus recovering my important files. My phone is not rooted.I bought a better SD Card and an SD Card reader and just tried copying my content to my PC. All photos and videos are showing up as Invalid Image :(My Questions:Does this \"Invalid Image\" prompt mean that the files are corrupt...forever?Could this be caused by the software I am viewing the files in, and if I view them in a different software, will they show up fine?Is there any way (via a photo recovery software) that I can recover these corrupt files? If so, what software(s) do you personally recommend?Thank you for any and all questions answered. I really appreciate it, I am at my wit's end with this problem and I had thousands of photos that were extremely important to me - losing them would honestly be devestating.
