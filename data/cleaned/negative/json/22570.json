If I try to download apps, i am taken to google play market and after a while i would receive a message telling me to log in. I log in with my Gmail account and then get a message saying that i have not logged onto google play with that phone before.That is about how far I get. There is no option to allow me to connect and no solution is proffered.Does anyone have a solution that will help because this is getting me frustrated and hating an otherwise great phone.",
