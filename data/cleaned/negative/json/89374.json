How can i do this?Or better still, I would like the factory reset to not do a factory reset, but instead, just re-run the initial set up wizard, thus not affecting any apps already installed. This way it seems like a factory reset has been done.The phone is a Samsung S4If anyone can assist, I would be a very grateful concerned parent.Thanks",
