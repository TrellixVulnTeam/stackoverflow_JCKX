Periodically (a few times a week), my Droid Bionic (stock Gingerbread 2.3.4) will lose access to all data services (Wifi, 3G\/4G) for no apparent reason.  The only sure way out seems to be powering the phone off and restarting it, although the last time I tried using Sleep instead of power off it did reset.
