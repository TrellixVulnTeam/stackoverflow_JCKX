I'm using a Moto Atrix 4G (MB860) running Android 2.3.6 bought from AT&T, and have tried a wide range of call recording apps but have yet to find one that actually works on my device. I notice that some apps explicitly explain that they don't work on Moto phones. Is this a hardware problem? Can I do anything to make it work?I would like my phone to automatically record all incoming and outgoing calls, and save them in a common audio file type in the SD card or internal storage of the phone.I've search the website, but the posts I found about call recording are neither specific to Atrix nor Motorola, which I believe are the key to the problem I currently have.(Despite that I bought the phone from the U.S., I live in a country where call recording is perfectly legal to the best of my knowledge.)",
