Since she is worried that she might go over her cap I want to know how can she track how much data she has used in a certain time (preferably within a billing period). I am on Sprint so I've never had to worry about how much data I use. My question is: Can you recommend a method to manage\/track data?Also, I figure that apps like weather and news should be changed to check less frequently... any other default apps that should be changed to check less frequently?Thanks for the help",
