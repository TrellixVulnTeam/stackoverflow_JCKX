    "Body":"Hi dear android\/linux enthusiast, first question on stackoverflow, until now I've got a lot of help just reading stackexchange.* in passive mode, thanks for all that!I want to make a keycharmap\/keylayout for my bluetooth keyboard in my android phone. I want it to behave like a dvorack-us-international keyboard. So I made all the web-research needed but I'm still missing one thing. In my PC the apostrophe key behaves as an acute key, if I press it once and then press a vowel, it writes the vowel with the acute (my native language is Spanish so I've become dependent on this \"feature\"), so I want this behavior in android.In my PC:APOSTROPHE A = \u00e1APOSTROPHE O = \u00f3APOSTROPHE Shift+A = \u00c1APOSTROPHE APOSTROPHE = \u00b4 (lonely acute)APOSTROPHE SPACE = 'Shift+APOSTROPHE A = \u00e4Shift+APOSTROPHE Shift+A = \u00c4Shift+APOSTROPHE Shift+APOSTROPHE = \u00a8 (umlaut)Shift+APOSTROPHE SPACE = \"So I made a keycharmap that has this:key APOSTROPHE {    label:                              '\\''    base:                               '\\u0301'    shift:                              '\\u0308'}(As sepecified in https:\/\/source.android.com\/devices\/tech\/input\/key-character-map-files.html#behaviors)But what I've got was this behavior:APOSTROPHE APOSTROPHE = \u00b4 (lonely acute)APOSTROPHE SPACE = \u00b4 (lonely acute)Shift+APOSTROPHE Shift+APOSTROPHE = \u00a8 (umlaut)Shift+APOSTROPHE SPACE = \u00a8 (umlaut)As you can see I'm missing the quote and double quote and I'd really like to have them.So, I tried something different:key APOSTROPHE {    label:                              '\\''    base:                               '\\u030D'    shift:                              '\\u030E'}(Looking at android sources http:\/\/omapzoom.org\/?p=platform\/frameworks\/base.git;a=blob;f=core\/java\/android\/view\/KeyCharacterMap.java;h=55dd6bb64fe65ba29c5f71ed9257ed9dbe7a3790;hb=HEAD and at unicode \"combining character\" in wikipedia)But didn't got what I wanted either. I saw that the character '\\u030E' was comment-out on the source code ok, but I had to try. So the question is:How do I get the behavior I want in android? Can't be done without modifying android sources? do I have to use key modifiers (ALT or CTRL) and stick with that?(I'm using cyanogenmod 11-20140708 based on kitkat 4.4.4 on a LG nexus 4 (mako))thanks!",
