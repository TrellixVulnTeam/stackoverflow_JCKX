But it runs quite slow and I dont want to go back to Android 1.x series.I am looking for some other Android 2.1 OS (other than Cyanogenmod) which are faster and have low memory requirements or does it remain the same among all Android 2.1 distributions?Another reason for change is that every 1 or 2 months, Cyanogenmod-5 starts behaving funny and I need to re-install my OS. For example, currently I am unable to read any texts (Messaging service - SMS) on my phone; application keeps on crashing. In the past similar issues were with Gmail and GTalk.So, I want to switch to something other than Cyanogenmod but Android-2.1. Any suggestions?",
