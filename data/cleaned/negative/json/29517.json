I attempted to transfer the photos located in the mnt\/emmc\/DCIM\/100MEDIA folder to the mnt\/sdcard\/DCIM\/100ANDRO folder using the Astro app so I could transfer to my computer like I have in the past.However, this time when I viewed the photos after the transfer, all of the photos show a file size of 0 KB except for the last two which work properly. I previously verified the photos were showing properly before the transfer. Strangely, the video  files did not seem to be affected.Has anyone heard of this problem in the past and know of a fix, or can anyone recommend a good file or photo recovery tool as a last recourse? Thanks for any help or suggestions.",
