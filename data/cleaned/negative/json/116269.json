    "Body":"I tried to install an app on my tablet called Applock, by a developer called Gizmoquip (I think there are a few apps with that by different developers). AVG came up with a message saying it will install adware, and malware to steal personal information, but it has more than 2 million downloads and very few bad reviews, and I can't find any information about it online anywhere else.Is AVG wrong, and it's actually a safe app?(EDIT: I'm sorry if it was an innappropriate question. Without anyone saying they downloaded it and are sure without a doubt that it is malware because it broke their phone or whatever, I'm afraid I really am just asking for a more informed opinion than my own.  But, since the issue is resolved now, and you've given me some very good advice, please feel free to close the question or delete it or whatever you need to do. If I have any other problems I'll try to think more about it before posting next time. Thank you!)",
