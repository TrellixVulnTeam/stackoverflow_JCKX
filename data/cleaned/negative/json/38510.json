Having problems with being able to move apps to external SD card that has 4 GB space. Every app downloaded can either be stored to phone or internal memory but there's not enough space there for my downloads. How can I move\/transfer apps that I've downloaded (like my games) from the market to my external SD Card? Can I do that manually? How? If there's another app from the market, can someone tell me which app does just that?",
