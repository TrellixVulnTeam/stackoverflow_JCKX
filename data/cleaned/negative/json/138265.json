    "Body":"So, there is an interesting situation.I had an accident earlier today, and my phone screen broke. I plugged it back in my laptop after comming hope, i knew i have usb debugging mode enabled and also i could access memory card through cable connection on my windows 10.Now, as i have my usb debugging enabled, i am sure their can be a way to access all the data on my phone, i want to recover all my contacts and data from phone storage. I am sure their would be some products for this or some sort of commands for this task. I am a software engineering student, so their is no issue doing any technical or command line work. I just need some direction.I am sure if someone explains a procedure here for this kind of situation. Possibaly using some commands or some tiny free tools. This would help many people in this situation.Edit: Its android 4.4.4 and Qmobile Z10 (China made)",
