    "Body":"Update of ADW Launcher EX is back again after a long time. It brings lot of visual tweaks as well as performance boosts. After few days of experience, I have encountered one even more interesting thing: I am unable to kill it by increasing system load (which is a very good thing).When foreground apps are launched, Android kills background apps based on minfree values. The apps having running services and notification get higher priority than normal background apps, but get lesser priority than foreground apps.Latest version of ADW Launcher EX has a running service (but no higher priority running notification) which is same as old versions and other launcher apps. I have used Go Launcher EX, LauncherPro, old version of ADW Launcher EX etc. All get killed when heavy foreground apps are launched, but latest version of ADW Launcher EX isn't getting killed. Instead, foreground apps are being killed when system load is high.Previously, hot reboot was also able to kill ADW Launcher EX, but now even that one fails.What's the magic behind all these? I am just curious...",
