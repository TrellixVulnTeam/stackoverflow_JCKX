I've noticed that when my Google Nexus One phone is showing ~20% of the battery, after using it for a minute or two it completely discharges to 0%. Everything started before two weeks or so. Before that phone was fine, but now if it's showing ~20% of battery, after a few minutes it turns off and when you turn it on, it shows that there are 0% left in a battery and turns off... Where's the problem?",
