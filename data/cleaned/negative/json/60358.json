    "Body":"There are a couple of tutorials or even questions here about creating an application for Android. But I was wondering, if I just want to compile an application from the available source on Github, I'm not going to develop anything, do I need to install the Android SDK, Eclipse with ADT plugin, and the SDK tools and platforms? In GNU\/Linux you just have to install the build tools and dependency libraries, not an IDE, which is generally for doing the development. How would you proceed in compiling the APK? Not that I want it to be like GNU\/Linux, but what are the required tools just for compiling? And do I need to downgrade my Java version to 6 when I'm compiling for Android 4.1.2 (if Java is needed)?Also, there are no build instructions on the source, including a few steps on your answer would be highly appreciated!I am trying to build KeepShare: https:\/\/github.com\/pfn\/keepshare",
