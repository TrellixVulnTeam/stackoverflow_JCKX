However, I am unable to make calls, send SMS and MMS and use the Internet (Mobile Data) due to the fact that I am in Australia and the ROM is not an International ROM.I am a developer. However my experience in this regard is limited. How would I go about making this ROM support Australian networks? If you know anything at all I would appreciate your help on this.
