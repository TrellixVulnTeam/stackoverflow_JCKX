My understanding was that if the tablet was rooted, I would have the ability to do this.If this is the case, though, I can't tell how. There is still no uninstall option in Settings->Applications->Manage Applications for the unwanted apps.Do I have to do something else?Is my tablet not actually rooted as I thought?Was I wrong that a rooted tablet would be able to remove bloatware?",
