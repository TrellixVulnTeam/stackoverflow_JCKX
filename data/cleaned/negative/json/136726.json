    "Body":"I have a fleet of vehicles (around 20 trucks). I want an app where I can create a list of the vehicles and then assign task to each vehicle (say vehicle1 is going from A to B) and the approx time vehicle1 will take to finish the job. This should mark vehicle1 as busy. Then I should not focus on this vehicle1 till its assigned time finishes, instead I will focus on other free vehicles.And as soon as the time of vehicle1 finishes, it should either ring up (alert) or turn the status to \"unknown\" so that I can again update its status if it takes more time to finish the job or else I should assign it the second job.My sole purpose it to manage which vehicle is free, so that I can make it busy again in order to become more profitable.Can you suggest any such free resource management app.",
