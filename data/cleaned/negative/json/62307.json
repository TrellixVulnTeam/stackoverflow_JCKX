But the thing that bothers me most is that iOS is silky smooth and Android is not, even on pretty powerful devices with multiple CPU and graphics cores.Is this something that's already overcome in newer Android or that is really on a problem on older\/cheaper devices? Or is it inherent due to Android being fully multitasking and based on Unix?Edit(In response to the possibility that this question invites opinion based answers) :This question is not intended to be opinion based but rather to gather information on real differences in software or hardware that are responsible for the large differences in test results of factors such as Touch screen responsiveness, and rendering speed of UI elements of the Android and iOS operating systems.Expected answer:Answer that pinpoints exact differences in software implementations and reasons for doing so that have lead to disparities in responsivenessDifferences in specific hardware (such as the touch screen) that can be a causeAll backed up with actual test results if possibleAny other relevant and well defined causes\/reasons",
