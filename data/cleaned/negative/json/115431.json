    "Body":"I'm having some issues with Android 5.1.0 and Nexus 4:Battery lasts a very short time, sometimes less than a day with the phone barely used. I don't have anything special installed, just popular apps that everyone uses. Looking at the battery usage I see \"Android OS\" and \"Google Play Services\" taking the biggest chunk. Screen comes 3rd, sometimes 4th (with adaptive brightness).Random deep sleeps. This is apparently a known issue for months, but no fix has come up yet.App crashes. \"Phone\" app sometimes crashes; Sometimes after you answer a call you don't hear anything and need to call back the person; \"Camera\" (requires phone restart to fix); \"Youtube\" stops playing videos every 2-3 days (requires phone restart to fix).Searching the web I noticed they are quite common.Is there any alternative Android OS that I can install to avoid them? I've heard of CyanogenMod. Does anyone know if it also has these problems on a Nexus 4 device?",
