I've been trying to connect it to ADB via usb, but it's not being found and I'm assuming this is because I don't have USB debugging enabled. My phone is running 4.4.2, and I'm using windows 7 to try and connect.I have some important information that I need to access, is there any way possible to enable USB debugging from my pc or otherwise connect the phone to ADB with debugging disable? I really really need some help with this, if anybody can help me at all it would be greatly appreciated.Edit: The question provided only provides an answer for a linux OS, I'm looking for solutions available in Windows 7",
