    "Body":"On my Motorola Moto G XT1068 with 5.0.2 whenever I'd turn on \"location\" it would ask permission to use high accuracy mode, and if I remember rightly, send information to Google. I always chose disagree because I don't want to do this.Today I was helping a friend trial an app and in order to get it to function properly I was forced agree to this. Now I have two problems:When I turn location on it always defaults to high accuracy, I cannot get it to default to device onlyI have no idea how to revoke this permission that I agreed toSo, my questions are: 1. How can I get it to default to device only? 2. How can I revoke this permission?Ideally I don't want to have to do a factory reset.And yes, I know, I shouldn't have said yes if I didn't agree, but silly me assumed I could easily revoke this permission.",
