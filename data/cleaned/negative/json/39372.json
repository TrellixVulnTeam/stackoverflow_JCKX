    "Body":"Quick background to the problem experienced: My phone has 3 types of memory: \"phone memory\" (less than 200 MB), \"internal memory\"(1 GB), and an SD card (4GB). When I first download any app, it goes directly to the phone memory. This is a problem, because the phone memory is so small and easily eaten up. Therefore, I must move move everything possible to my internal memory. Apps such as Ruzzle and Voxer give me the option to \"move to internal memory\" in the application manager. However, some of the most memory intensive apps such as facebook do not allow this option (the option is greyed out). Is there any solution to this problem? ",
