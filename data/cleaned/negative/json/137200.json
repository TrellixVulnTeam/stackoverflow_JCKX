    "Body":"So I bought a Samsung s5 on a Groupon deal a while back, and my Girlfriend owns a Bush Tablet. We are looking to get them rooted. The problem is, my phone originates from somewhere in Eastern Europe, and so no one has gotten around to rooting that specific model number, and her tablet is an Argos Exclusive, so no one has rooted it either. Is there a way for us to use some sort of Generic, all purpose Android Rooter on them, rather than having to wait for someone to root that specific model?",
