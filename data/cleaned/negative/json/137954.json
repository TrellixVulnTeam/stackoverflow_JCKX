Does Signal has built in feature for VoiP calling or it uses existing phone \/ skype feature and just wrap it with its encryption ?I clicked on call button and it ask me either I want to call via skype or via phone, so seems like signal has no built in call feature like facebook\/skype , is that correct ?2) I just want to confirm the call encryption and want to see how digits appear on the screen before the call (that both parties verifies for integrity)Can I get some screenshot or picture about this ? Thanks",
