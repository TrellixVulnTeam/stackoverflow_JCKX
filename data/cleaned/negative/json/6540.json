I want to connect my phone to my computer via USB, and be able to send keystrokes to phone, and send phone's video output to computer screen. It's easy, i check out several tutorials, but i DON'T want to root my phone, i don't want to void my warranty. Is there ANY way to send keystrokes to Android phone from any \"third-party\" device, or to send phone's video output to computer without rooting the phone?",
