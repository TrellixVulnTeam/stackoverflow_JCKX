    "Body":"I have tried to figure this out and I'm at a loss.I am in the process or making a custom kernel for android and when I flash it it says my external sd card is empty or is not supported.I have went the the kernel config and made sure file systems ( ext2, ext3, ext4, NTFS.) But still no dice.When I plug my external sd card in a adapter and view on my computer I see all the files and even when I put it back into my phone and boot in recovery I can see all the files. Its just when I boot normally.I also can flash my stock kernel recovery and I can see my sdcard again.Which is why I think it's kernel related.If anyone could help me I would really really appreciate it. I can't think of what I can change.Thanks,Zach",
