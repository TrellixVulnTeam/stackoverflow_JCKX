    "Body":"My two-year-old was playing with my (locked) Galaxy Nexus, and when she eventually handed it back to me, it was at the \"Welcome\" new phone setup screen.I'm guessing that she managed to hold down buttons and eventually end up at the factory reset option.So I guess my first question is, was the phone definitely factory reset?  Is there any other case in which the phone would boot up to this screen?Second, assuming it was a factory reset, and I have never setup any backup software or anything like that, what are my options for recoving pictures and SMS messages?I assume that my only real option is to somehow snapshot the raw disk device(s) onto my computer and from there run file recovery software on the image.  Is that the case, or are there other options?  If so, how do I copy the raw disk device(s)?Thanks.",
