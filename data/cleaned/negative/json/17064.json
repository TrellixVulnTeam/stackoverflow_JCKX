    "Body":"I left my tablet home for the entire day, in standby mode and under charge. When I came back, I found the screen was on and the device was quite warm. A few nights ago, I was awaken by the brightness of the screen at 4AM (revived without apparent reason) and never managed to sleep again until I got up to shut it down completely.I understand that there could be a program running with permission to prevent standby mode for the device, but since 70% of the software I installed require this permission I'm a bit confused.If I return to the desktop and put the device to sleep, why the hell should some app  revive it from standby? I understand that a movie player, when focused, wants to avoid the device to enter standby, but I really don't get why should apps revive the device to lockscreen and never let it go sleep again.It only happens when I'm not in Airplane mode.Is there a way to find which application revived the screen and damn uninstall it?I have installed stock HC3.2 rooted from XDA Developers.[Add] A few log lines06-08 21:49:42.630 I\/Email   (1256): ReconcilePopImapAccountsSync: done06-08 21:49:44.490 D\/Email   (1256): *** synchronizeMailboxGeneric ***06-08 21:49:45.590 I\/AlarmManager(792): Alarm type : 2, from setRepeating operation : com.android.email06-08 21:49:45.590 I\/AlarmManager(792): ----Alarm type: 2Second:41988.40300000006-08 21:49:45.930 D\/dalvikvm(13597): GC_EXPLICIT freed 28K, 9% free 7121K\/7751K, paused 7ms+2ms06-08 21:49:51.510 V\/AlarmManager(792): --- from triggerAlarmsLocked operation: android06-08 21:49:51.510 I\/AlarmManager(792): ----Alarm type: 2Second:42300.006-08 21:49:51.550 I\/Email   (1256): ReconcilePopImapAccountsSync: start06-08 21:49:51.550 I\/AlarmManager(792): Alarm type : 2, from setRepeating operation : com.android.email06-08 21:49:53.150 V\/AlarmManager(792): --- from triggerAlarmsLocked operation: com.acer.ap.sns06-08 21:49:53.150 I\/AlarmManager(792): ----Alarm type: 3Second:42674.72300000006-08 21:49:53.180 D\/BatteryService(792): level:39 scale:100 status:3 health:2 present:true voltage: 3768 temperature: 295 technology: Li-ion AC powered:false USB powered:false icon:17302707 invalid charger:006-08 21:49:55.570 I\/AlarmManager(792): Alarm type : 3, from setRepeating operation : android06-08 21:49:55.570 I\/AlarmManager(792): ----Alarm type: 3Second:42590.99700000006-08 21:49:55.670 I\/Email   (1256): ReconcilePopImapAccountsSync: done06-08 21:49:55.860 W\/BatteryService(792): Unknown battery status ';\u0788\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd@'06-08 21:49:55.860 I\/power   (792): *** set_screen_state 1Thank you",

I understand that a movie player, when **focused**, wants to avoid the device to enter standby, but I really don't get why should apps revive the device to lockscreen and **never** let it go sleep again.Is there a way to force the behaviour of the power\/standby button to **prevent** the device **from reviving**?Some info: along the day I received a few emails and I didn't get any single Skype messages. These could be the most common causes of resume IMHO. A sound and a vibration are enough for me, especially when the device is in a bag.I have installed stock HC3.2 rooted from XDA Developers.Thank you"
