    "Body":"I am an IT professional (but not in app development). Two days ago  someone contacted me about a blog post I made and invited me to participate in beta testing for a messaging app which was related to my blog post. I have never before considered participating in beta testing for a mobile app before. For the android app, they are using Closed beta with Google+ community or Google Group.At first, I was enthusiastic, but then I thought --- whoa! I don't know this person (or this company) from Adam. Although the developer's website looks legitimate, this person contacted ME, so this could all be a setup. The instructions to download the beta app seem straightforward and seem similar to how legitimate apps do beta testing. And frankly, I doubt that this app has any malicious purpose. On the other hand, I have no reason to trust this app. In fact, when I begin the steps for downloading the app and seei what privileges I am granting, I literally have no idea what the implications are.So let me ask: Are beta apps basically operating in a safe sandbox? Are theresignificant differences in security risks between android and ios?Generally is it easy to uninstall them? When evaluating whether to install a beta app, is there an accesslevel which I should be careful not to grant? Is there any sort of community rating system that might reassure methat an app is more likely to be safe? I see all kinds of websiteswhich list apps for beta testers. Is there any reason to believethat apps listed on these kinds of sites are vetted or determined tobe safe (or do not pose security risks)? Are  certain kinds of apps  riskier to install as beta apps than others?I assume that I should monitor performance (such as memory and storage use) when the app is running. Is there any metric I should be monitoring to ensure that the beta app is not dragging down overall performance?Thanks for your help. Hopefully your answers can help other clueless potential beta testers like myself. I would love to participate in more beta-testing if I could be convinced that it would not pose a significant risk for me. I have worked in software development before and even done a bit of testing on desktop apps  but I had VMs and understand the security model for Windows and Linux fairly well. But I only have one phone and 2 tablets (ios and android), and don't want to mess things up (though I regularly test ebook design on multiple platforms and displays). ",
