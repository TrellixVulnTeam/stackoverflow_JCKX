    "Body":"In general, how can I know whether my 4G phone with a non-stock ROM still has 4G functionality?I've read in various forums and how-tos that rooting and flashing a new ROM on your 4G Android device may disable its 4G functionality. These forums say that 4G working all depends on which device, rooting method, radio driver and ROM you use.For example, I have an HTC Evo 4G with MIUI. Model: PC36100Android: 2.3.7Baseband: 2.15.00.11.19Kernel: 2.6.37-cyanogenmod-01493-g70877de, shade@toxygene #1In my settings, I have options to switch from 2G to 3G, but I don't see anything in the menus that even recognizes the existence of 4G. However, that doesn't necessarily mean 4G doesn't work, but I can't seem to find this information anywhere on the internet. So how can I know whether my 4G phone with a non-stock ROM still has 4G functionality?",
