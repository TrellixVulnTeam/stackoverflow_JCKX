Is there any way I can get them through my pc?To be clear, the screen is completely blank but I can still unlock it via touch pattern.  It takes a few tries but Android File Transfer on the mac will tell me if it can or can't connect.  If it can't, I just try again and I can get it.  So the touch part still works, it just doesn't show any information.The phone is a Galaxy Nexus.  When I connect it to my Mac, I can see the files in it via the Android File Transfer window. However, I can't find the texts here.I have the Android SDK installed and I was told I can do this:adb pull \/data\/data\/com.android.providers.telephony\/databases\/mmssms.dbHowever the device shows up as offline when I do adb devices.  I can't figure out a way get it showing up as online without being able to use the screen.",
