    "Body":"One thing I do miss about my blackberry was a single list of all my communication.  I went to \"Messages\" and I had texts, emails, bbm, chat, notifications, everything all in one list.  With a few email addresses, texting, and other apps all notifying me, it's great that I have the notification bar about new messages, but when trying to find something I got just a few days ago, it's hard to remember if it was an email? which email? text? etcIs there a similar app that combines all communication into a single list?",
