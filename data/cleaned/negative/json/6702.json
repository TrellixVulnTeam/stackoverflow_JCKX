    "Body":"I am thinking about getting an iPad 2 just so I can record music on Garageband, provided I find a way to input a USB mic. Anyways, I am admittedly a Google and Android fan and would much rather go that route and record music using an Android tablet where there would for sure be much more interoperability and maybe even a cloud sync service where I could collaborate with another musician 1,000 miles away in high quality, lossless form. Is there an app on Android or a web app that would support this kind of user experience on par with the user experience of Garageband?I don't mind sticking with an iPad 2 for a year and then going back to Android when something more mature for Android comes out, but just thought I would ask here first.",
