    "Body":"Hi I have just bought another android phone, but I really want to see the old messages.  When I purchase my new phone, I had to obtain a nano sim, I managed to keep my old number for the new phone (still have the old phone with another sim in it).  On the old phone I can still see old messages, but as soon as I go to look at old messages and pictures, Whats app thinks I have\/want two accounts and then blocks the new phone.  I just want to be able to see all my old messages on my new phone, what can I do.  Also, I am not the most technical person going, but help would be fantastic please.  My messages mean a lot to me.  Thank you.",
