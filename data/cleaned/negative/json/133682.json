I believe it includes UI tweaks and hardware drivers for the phone model, and installing the public vanilla Android on a phone would be more difficult than installing Linux on a computer. I don't know if it would also hurt the user experience (i.e. by lacking the manufacturer's tweaks & drivers).Is it reasonable to say that typing passwords isn't as safe on a pre-installed OS, or on a proprietary OS, as it is on a vanilla OS which is developed in the public eye and which you download and install yourself?How do we reason about trusting a piece of software, or about what it does? Are there technical mechanisms for this? Do we also base our reasoning on social mechanisms?",
