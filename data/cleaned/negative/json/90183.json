    "Body":"I just got a ZTE Midnight literally today and when I tried to download some of my favorite apps, it told me the memory was full. So I went in to see what was on my internal memory, and its already full from the apps the phone comes with, aka, apps that I can't delete. So I tried to set my default download location to my SDcard and after a completely failed attempt at googling how to do it, I decided to try asking about it on here. If somebody could give me a hand with this and possibly save me from breaking said brand new phone, that would be amazing. Thank you.",
