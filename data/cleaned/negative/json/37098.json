I have a very basic grasp of this concept. I think what I've found is that rooted devices can be 'unrooted' but only if one knows what rooted it originally. I've found this: You\u2019ll have to use either a terminal emulator or ADB. Here are the commands to uninstall it: mount -o remount,rw \/systemrm \/system\/app\/Superuser.apkWould that be a good way to remove the root from all cells across the board? Specifically what I need to know is what do rooted devices mean to the cell phone data clear industry? Is there user data in a rooted device after data clearing it manually? ",
