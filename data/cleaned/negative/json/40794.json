When that same SMS comes to my Android the phone number comes through as some download that I can't just click on to make the call back.Does anyone know of a way that will allow for this \"clickability\" feature for the Android? (from an iPhone SMS sent to me). I looked at Handcent, and GoSMS already but they can't do it properly.Any suggestions would be most appreciated.",
