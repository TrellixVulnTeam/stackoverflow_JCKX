Why can't my device see an ad-hoc WiFi network?I created an ad hoc Wi-Fi network on my Windows XP laptop but I don't see it in my Samsung's network list. Why? I found instructions online on how to unlock ah hoc Wi-Fi support on Android. Is it really impossible to connect to ad hoc networks by default? What is the alternative? How can I connect my laptop and Tab?UPDATEI saw that ad hoc Wi-Fi is now called Wi-Fi Direct. Is this true? But settings for XP's ad hoc Wi-Fi are unrelated to Android's Wi-Fi Direct: the former requires an SSID and a key, while the latter requires only a device name. Also, Android's Wi-Fi Direct scanner sees no ad hoc network being published by the XP laptop.",
