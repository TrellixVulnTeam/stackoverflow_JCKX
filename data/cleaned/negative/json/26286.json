E.g. memory sticks and other USB storage (mass storage class).I am not looking for rooted devices (I know that such procedure can make a device support USB OTG\/USB Host if the hardware supports it). I am looking for official support, out-of-the box. Some devices may require adapter cables if necessary (i.e. micro USB to female USB socket).So far I know at least one device that supports USB OTG \/ USB host out-of-the-box (non rooted): The GoTab GBT740R 7\" Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich tablet, costing just 100 pounds or less in UK! This device has a full size USB female socket to support USB OTG \/ USB Host. A friend owns one, his USB memory sticks work in this - we can browse to the USB stick contents using Astro File Manager App on the tablet. (By the way, I don't work for GoTab). This seems to be a feature-rich device though for the price point: microSD and HDMI also supported.Any more devices? usb.org doesn't seem to have a list, well I haven't found it yet, nor Wikipedia entries.",
