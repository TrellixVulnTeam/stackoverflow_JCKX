Can I install Android on my non-Android device?I am going to buy a new computer in the next 3-4 months and I am thinking about getting a high quality 13.1 inch Windows 8 Ultrabook. I am going to dual boot both Windows8 (for work stuff) and Ubuntu (so I can have something that will actually work). I am looking into getting one of the new touch screen enabled ultra books with folding down displays to form a tablet as well. I was wondering if I could also boot Android 4 or if Android was limited to ARM devices.",
