    "Body":"I changed the bootimage of an Android device and it bricked. It's freezing at the boot image. I try to install a ROM using fastboot but I have a permission error. I try to connect with adb but I can't, the device doesn't appear in the list of devices. I need to enter to the file sytem and replace the bootimage or install a ROM or a Recovery without ADB. The device is an ASUS Memopad HD7 and it's rooted. I think the problem with bootloader is that it isn't unlocked. I try to use flashtool but it's searching all time because the PC doesn't recognize the device. It's recognized only if I start the fastboot mode and it appears like HTC Dream. If I start in normal mode it appears like a storage but it doesn't appear in file explorer or adb.",
