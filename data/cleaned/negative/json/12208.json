There doesn't seem to be an Exit option when I press the Menu button in the browser, either.For whatever reason, Android rarely kills it like it does with other apps. It takes up quite a bit of memory and even CPU time when in the background. Either way, all my other apps exit nicely and I'd prefer that the browser did too.Is there any way I can get the browser to exit?  One could use a task killer but it's a bit of a hassle and it seems to leak memory when I kill it with TouchWiz's built-in task manager, besides the fact that task killers suck.I have a Galaxy S Vibrant running Android 2.2 with TouchWiz.",
