    "Body":"I was playing around with a friend's iPhone the other day. I'm a total anti-Apple, but I can recognize niceties when I see them. The Stocks app on the iPhone seemed much more concise and useful than any I've tried on Android. Specifically I like how it is laid out with all your pertinent information right there. Symbol, price, and change. WITH the chart also shown on the screen. The little top section with the symbols is scrollable within its own space if you have more than fit in it, but the chart stays where it is. Does anyone know if there is a port (or highly similar app) of the iPhone's \"Stocks\" app available for Android? Ideally, it needs to be an app which can also handle symbols for mutual funds well (with charting), as my investments are all in mutual funds, not direct stocks.I've tried the Yahoo stocks app, Google's, TD Bank's and most recently E*TRADE's. But they all seem to have a very cluttered feel, or don't bring together your basic information all in one place leaving you to flip between several screens. Cheers, and thanks!",
