    "Body":"For some reason my class is not running, I was using some demo\/example code and added some logs to figure out why it wasn't working. It turns out I have a class that isn't even running properly when called. This is an android application that takes a picture without a preview by using the camera hardware directly.In my main class I have this:public void onClick(View view) {    Log.d(DEBUG_TAG, \" . . . onClick running\");    if (camera != null) {        Log.d(DEBUG_TAG, \" . . . Camera does not equal null - Taking picture\");        camera.takePicture(null, null,            new PhotoHandler(getApplicationContext()));    }}As you can see above, after my Log says that the application is \"Taking picture\", it should run camera.takePicture, using context new PhotoHandler (which is my class that won't execute) -- because in my PhotoHandler.java I have this:@Overridepublic void onPictureTaken(byte[] data, Camera camera) {    Log.d(MakePhotoActivity.DEBUG_TAG, \". . . Running PhotoHandler.java\");Which is my main method of that particular class. The thing is, I never receive the Log saying \"Running PhotoHandler.java\" and a picture never saves. In fact none of my Logs from PhotoHandler.java ever run, so that's why I believe the whole class isn't running.Here are my logs:    02-26 11:50:17.556 4542-4542\/camera.camerasnap D\/MakePhotoActivity: Camera found02-26 11:50:17.556 4542-4542\/camera.camerasnap D\/MakePhotoActivity: Camera id = 002-26 11:50:17.692 4542-4542\/camera.camerasnap D\/MakePhotoActivity: Else: Camera that was found: 002-26 11:50:17.713 4542-4585\/camera.camerasnap D\/OpenGLRenderer: Use EGL_SWAP_BEHAVIOR_PRESERVED: false02-26 11:50:17.723 4542-4542\/camera.camerasnap D\/Atlas: Validating map...02-26 11:50:17.784 4542-4585\/camera.camerasnap D\/libEGL: loaded \/system\/lib\/egl\/libEGL_tegra.so02-26 11:50:17.802 4542-4585\/camera.camerasnap D\/libEGL: loaded \/system\/lib\/egl\/libGLESv1_CM_tegra.so02-26 11:50:17.839 4542-4585\/camera.camerasnap D\/libEGL: loaded \/system\/lib\/egl\/libGLESv2_tegra.so02-26 11:50:17.877 4542-4585\/camera.camerasnap I\/OpenGLRenderer: Initialized EGL, version 1.402-26 11:50:17.886 4542-4585\/camera.camerasnap D\/OpenGLRenderer: Enabling debug mode 002-26 11:50:26.720 4542-4542\/camera.camerasnap D\/MakePhotoActivity:  . . . onClick running02-26 11:50:26.720 4542-4542\/camera.camerasnap D\/MakePhotoActivity:  . . .
