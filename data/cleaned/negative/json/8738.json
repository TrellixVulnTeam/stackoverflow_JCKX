    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  How to fix \u201cInvalid IMEI \u201d after Factory reset?  Hi. I followed Three.ie support and performed a factory reset on my HTC HD2 running Android 2.2.1. It now displays 'Invalid IMEI' where the SIM connection detail should be. I purchased the phone from China and have been using it with an O2 SIM but the reception in my area is bad so I sent for a three.ie SIM. This also worked OK but I queried why it was connectiong to Vodafone.ie and not three.ie. I was told to do a factory reset to correct this. The reset has now made the phone unusable. I have the original IMEI number printed inside the phone. This is 354120034327435. Please help.regardsDave",
