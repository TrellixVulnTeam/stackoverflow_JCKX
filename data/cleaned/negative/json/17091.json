            "Text":"I have an HTC Thunderbolt running Cyanogenmod 7.1.1.I drive a 2011 Nissan Juke, which supports bluetooth phones, but not A2DP audio playback.I purchased an A2DP adapter called [Cicada by Sewell][1].I have easily paired my phone to the Cicada which pipes audio to the aux jack in the Juke, and plays back. (Sounds great, incidentally.)However, upon connecting to the Cicada, the phone is no longer connected to the Juke for phone calls. Is there a way to tell Android to force send HSP data to the Juke and force all A2DP data to the Cicada? My intuition is the Cicada tells android it supports HSP and therefore overrides the Juke pairing.
