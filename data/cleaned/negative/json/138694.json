    "Body":"I was wondering if anyone could help me. I was looking through the internet trying to figure out the problem of why Google play store was asking me about authentication to be able to download a certain app. I found an answer so I tried it and it made the error message pop up that says \"error retrieving information for server [RH-01]. What I did to make this message pop up was go to my settings and go to application manager.  Then I went to Google play store. I then cleared data and forced to stop. Ever since I did that the play store has not been working and this error message has been popping up. Could anyone please help me on fixing this error. ",
