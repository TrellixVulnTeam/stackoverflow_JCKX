    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Where does Google Music store offline songs?  I have about 8 gigs of music stored within Google Music, and I recently got sick of streaming (and risking data charges), so I painstakingly allowed it to be stored offline. So my fresh 16 gig SD card now only had 8 gigs left. Then, I flashed a new rom, thinking that all my music would still be there cached (or however it works), but I was wrong. When I click \"show offline tracks only\" within the Google Music app, it shows nothing, yet my SD card still only has 8 gigs of space left.So, my question is, where are these offline tracks stored on my SD card so I can go in and delete them, to free up space so I can back them all up again?Thanks!And also, why won't the app recognize that there is offline music stored on my SD card after a new rom is flashed? I figured that data would be untouched across roms. ",
