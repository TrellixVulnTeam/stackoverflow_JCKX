    "Body":"I own a tablet without 3G\/phone functionality but equipped with Wi-fiThere is a lot of mixing up RF (radio frequency) with EMF (electric magnetic field) when looking for health issues arising from radiation.So :if there is no 3G functionality, am I safe from RF ?if there is Wifi then there should be RF too. If Wif-fi is enabled but not connected to a network, does it emit RF ?EMF is another one, but a property of all electrically powered. In what case is it more emitted by the tablet ie when wi-fi is on ?Which one is dangerous to health , RF or EMF RF vs EMF ? I see that there are cases that reduce radiation but all are concerned with RF and not EMF. Is there a solution that works for reducing EMF emission?",
