    "Body":"I have been a proud owner of a samsung galaxy i9000 for about a year now. However, my phone recently developed a problem that I had not anticipated. The phone now just switches off on its own. Sometimes it can do so up to 5 times a day. One moment the phone will be working and you go on with whatever you will be doing and before you know it the phone is off. The phone cannot be restarted using the normal on and off button. I actually have to remove the battery and put it back for the phone to restart again. Anyone with a clue?",
