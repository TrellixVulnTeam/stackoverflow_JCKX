    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Can gmail notifications be customized by label?  I have a filter in gmail that sets some of the mail to skip the inbox and be archived (unread) under a specific label. On the desktop Gmail, this label is shown alongside my regular inbox, which makes everything nice and organized. Unfortunately, on my Gmail android app, I don't get notified of any of these e-mails that skip the inbox and go to this label. I have already set this label to be synced by the app, but I'm still not getting notifications. How can I get notified of e-mails that skip the inbox and go straight to a specific label?So far I've only found Gmail Label Notifier, but I don't need all this customization and I was hoping to find something free.",
