    "Body":"I have samsung galaxy ace GT-S5830, it has very low internal memory (181 MB).I have an external micro SD card of 16 GB, but still couldn't install many apps due to insufficient internal memory.I read in internet that if i modify vold.fstab and replace the word sdcard with sdcard2 in it, then my external sd card will act as internal memory.So I rooted my phone and got superuser app (which can allow root access to various user apps)But I haven't installed clockworkmod recovery or any other custom ROM yet.I installed ES File explorer on SD card and allowed root access to it via superuser app.I then went to \/system\/etc\/ from ES file explorer , edited vold.fstab and replaced the word sdcard with sdcard2 Now i restarted my phone and the external SD is no more accessible. My \"ES File Explorer\" is also no more there for me to able to undo the change that i did.I tried intalling ES file explorer again from my data connection, but the installation fails (and phone reboots immediately).I am not able to install any new apps. I am unable to access my external SD card, so I can't put anything there via PC or via recovery. I tried pressing the power button + home button to go into system recovery mode. I see only these optionsAndrod system recovery reboot system nowapply sdcard:update.zipwipe data\/factory resetwipe cache partitionWhen i try to select the second option, it says installation aborted as the SD card is no more accessible I tried to select 3rd and 4th options, but that didn't help either - I think factory reset will not reset vold.fstab :-(I only have the default apps + superuser app nowI somehow need to find a way to get write permission to \/system\/etc or to \/system\/etc\/vold.fstabLuckily I found \"Android Commander\". Installing it on my windows PC and I am able to connect my android phone and I am able to access root folder. But I am not able to push a modified vold.fstab to \/system\/etc because Android Commander says \"no Root Access\" - It is seeing it as read only :-(can someone let me know how i can edit this file again ? I have a original vold.fstab in my PC, but I am not able to push it to my phone via Android Commander as Android Commander is seeing it as Read Only.Is there a way to give root access (aka read-write access) to Android Commander via superuser app on my android ?Is there any other way to get write permission to \/system\/etc\/vold.fstab so that i can modify it or replace it ?",
