I've been searching google for this and I haven't been able to find a clear answer for this. Some say it's \"insecure connection to Google servers\", others say it's only blue when it's syncing etc.The idea is that connecting to two different WiFi routers I get different icons.One shows blue, the other grey. The only difference between them is that the one that shows grey uses a certificate to authenticate, while the blue one uses a password, like any regular router.So what's up?",
