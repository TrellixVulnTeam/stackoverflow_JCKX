(I have no idea of how contacts are formatted so unsure whether or not they could just be moved from Sony to a Samsung so simply).They are the 2 main thought processes I have - any feed back on whether these are possible would be greatly appreciated as there are some very important numbers on this Xperia that I need for work!Thanks in advance (Apologies if this is in the wrong section, or doesn't necessarily class as an Android issue!)UPDATE: Seems I can't use adb Shell due to USB debugging being disabled and Screencast is a no go due to the phone not being rooted.I can see files within the Internal Storage such as .anchor, Alarms, Albums), is there a particular file within these subfolders which may contain the contacts which coul potentially be read?
