    "Body":"My smartphone has Operating System called \"Android 5.0\".I need to install windows 8 on that smartphone!    My smartphone is \"Asus ZenFone 2 (ZE551ML)\"    which is based on \"Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 Z3580 (2.3GHz)\" CPU!https:\/\/www.asus.com\/Phone\/ZenFone_2_ZE551ML\/specifications\/It has a lot of solid state memory \"64GB\" where is written this Android 5.0 We know that the phone's OS is really stored on flash memory they are not stored on \"ROMs\" at all.   Android ROMs got this name because they in part, take from the first.Android devices have onboard memory that is partitioned in 2,one for the OS, and another for the User Data, the OS portion, being the part that we overwrite with a ROM, is ReadOnly.The OS is not installed on a ROM, it is installed on a Read Only partition of the device which can be modified using root.  Does changing ROMs needs root privilege?Does my phone need to be rooted before changing ROM?Anyway how to do this at all?Or is it even possible to install windows 8 on any smartphone which is based on Android?",
