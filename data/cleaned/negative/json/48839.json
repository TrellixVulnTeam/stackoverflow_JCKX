I have made no alterations to my phone other than trying out various suggestions on given on forum sites. I have tried 3-word messages as a test and even these are converted to MMS.I have loaded both Handcent and Bigsms. They work, but why should I have to have these after 2 years and 3 weeks without a problem?",
