    "Body":"I have a Micromax AQ4501 mobile phone. I am getting an exclamation mark over the Wi-Fi icon. And I am unable to connect to Wi-Fi thereafter.I have been facing this problem since a few days after I upgraded my phone to Lollipop 5.0. I tried many things like:switching off and then on, replacing SIM from slot 1 to slot 2, switching mobile data and Wi-Fi connection on and then offbut all in vain. I called the Google call center but they were also unable to help me. I am able to use internet through mobile internet, but unable to use Wi-Fi with this phone. My Wi-Fi is working fine on other gadgets like my laptop. How can I resolve this problem?",
