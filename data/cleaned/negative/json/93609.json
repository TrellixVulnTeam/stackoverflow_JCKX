    "Body":"I own a spice phone which have low internal memory and ram but it is rooted. My question is that is it possible to play high end games like GTA vice city or nfs on that phone.  I had Googled about it but it makes more confusion. Some sites say yes and some no. Can anybody tell exactly the answer. It is running on android 4.2 and I had played some big games like angry birds epic and prince of persia on my device. They worked great. I can increase internal memory and ram also but after that, do really big games will work. Though GTA is a very large file so please help me solving this. ",
