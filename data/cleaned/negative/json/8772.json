    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Viewing web pages offline.  Hi,I just got a new Acer tablet, and was looking forward to reading HTML files in addition to PDF on my tablet during my commute: case in point being the Android documentation which is available in offline form in the doc\/ directory in the sdk install.So I copied the doc\/ folder from my PC to my tablet, and browsed to it using Astro, but was saddened to find that HTML files on the SD card are not easily accessible by the browser, which brings me to my question:Is there an app (preferably open source), which can provide a basic web server (only localhost, simply serving HTML, JS, CSS and image files) so I can access files by typing URLs such as http:\/\/localohost\/android-docs\/index.html ?I have looked at iJetty, but it seems to be doing too much. I just want to serve files, not do much Java.Thanks in advance.-A",
