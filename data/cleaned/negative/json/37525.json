It would then append the result of the ping, GPS position, and the time to a file on my phone. It would run every 10 seconds or so. Basically, I just want to get a view of my cellphone's Internet connection throughout the day and at different times. After a full day of this app running, I could then look at the generated file and figure out all sorts of interesting analytics for my phone.If there is no such app, is there any quick script or something that would do this?",
