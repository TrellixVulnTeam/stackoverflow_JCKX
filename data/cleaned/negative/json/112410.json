    "Body":"This is my first time posting to Stack Exchange, so if I can improve my question, please let me know!I have an external keyboard which I want to use with my Samsung Galaxy Tab S tablet. I would also like to use a Chinese\/English IME with my keyboard. Unfortunately, the key sequence for switching languages for most IMEs seems to be Shift+Space. This is a terrible shortcut for the many languages which use the Shift key frequently (including English).As far as I can tell, there are two possible methods to fix this issue:1) Find\/write an IME with sane shortcuts2) Intercept keys before they reach the IME and converts Shift+Space into Space and then converts a different key sequence into Shift+Space (this would need root I imagine)Here is the nearest related question I could find, but the solution given there is language specific (Russian):Pressing Shift+Space on an external keyboard switches keyboard layoutAny help here would be very appreciated!",
