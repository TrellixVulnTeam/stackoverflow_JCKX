But I never really get the recent apps system. For example, when I delete a game from my recent apps history, will the game close? Because when I delete it, and I start the game again, it will restart from the menu. When I don't delete the game from the recent history, It will just open where I closed it!But I thought recent apps is meant to show the user what apps u used recently, right?Is there any other way I can close my apps?",
