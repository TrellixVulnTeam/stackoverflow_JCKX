The way that worked was as you type it would litter the keybord with suggested next words.  I could select one of the words by swiping my finger up from the word toward the type-in field.  It was common that I could type a whole sentence simply by typing the first part of the first work, then just swiping the correct choices for the following words.The android google keyboard only gives me three choices of words and rarely the correct word I have in my head.How can I configure the android phone to give better (approaching blackberry quality) predictive text?Jim",
