But reading about them is a bit confusing, often earlier versions of the Android OS are mentioned, it only works with a few keyboards, users giving negative reviews that it didn't work for them etc.I'm looking for something that does work, and has as few drawbacks as possible.If someone knows why Google doesn't support it \"out of the box\" that would be interesting too.",
