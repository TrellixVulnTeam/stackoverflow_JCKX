    "Body":"BackgroundI have a 16GB Samsung micro SD card that I use on my Samsung Galaxy tablet. It has 116 videos and tons of pics and songs. One day I recorded a concert and when my tablet's battery became low I switched the SD card to my Galaxy S3 phone. It recorded fine and was able to upload some of the videos on a website. One morning, I was taking a picture from my Galaxy S3 phone which still has the 16gb card, when I checked the gallery, it has nothing on it but the new pic I took.I then realized that I've lost all my files for some reason, devastated but was able to recover the files via a FREE download of Wondershare Data Recovery software (which I actually ended up paying) and saved it on my PC. I was able to recover the pics, the songs I can open but only plays for 4 seconds. When I tried opening the video files, some are fine and was able to play them on my computer some won't let me. They are 3gp file extensions. I've tried playing them on a 3gp media player but they still don't play.My question is:Why am I able to play some of them fine and not the others? I've tried inserting the videos on my tablet and on my s3 phone it says:  CANNOT PLAY VIDEO. UNSUPPORTED FILE FORMATI am devastated and would really like to recover them. Is there any other solution?",
