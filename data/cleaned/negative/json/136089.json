I live in Luxembourg, have a Lux SIM card and bought my phone in Thailand and yet the Google Pay Topics are all in Italian. I lived in Italy years ago but I'm not using anything that I got in Italy. I've tried clearing the cache on the app, but I get the same thing and it's also on my laptop, which I purchased recently in Lux as well. It's really annoying. How can I change it? Please help.",
