    "Body":"I am a Android developer who has been noticing horrible performance and memory dumps that are crashing my Droid Charge SCH-i510. Besides the lack of roadmap for the phone ( because obviously they are targeting newer models) I know it will never really be updated again.But I would like to see if any one else is having these issues and if they were able to pin point it. Does anyone know how to solve this issue or overcome it? Obviously not everyone will have the exact same issues. But I notice the issue when processing images as well when a specific thread is chewing resources. I reached out to Samsung and I was told to \"Not have a lot of apps installed on the phone\" or to \"Not use so many apps on the phone\" I tried to explain to them that Android when not using an app has a lifecycle that will free up resources from apps not being used so that it will not run out of resources. They just responded to that as \"We are sorry you are mad\" Great job helping your dev's pin point an issue. ",
