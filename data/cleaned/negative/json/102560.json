    "Body":"So, I made a mistake. My LG G3 was Android Lollipop and I used a new method to root it (the video is on YouTube, a guy doing it on G Flex 2). Then I wanted to test something with CyanogenMod, so I downloaded TWRP image and flashed it with flashify.The phone died. I got certification boot something and I wasn't able to boot. The only option was download mod. So kmz (or something like this) then I did it and it did a factory reset too.Well, I had 400 pictures in my \/DCIM folder, all for my project and they are all gone. I normally would've gotten backups in TWRP and I had no idea installing it would kill my phone.And now I need those photos.I tried many things, specially Dr. Fone, and although I grant the root access for the program, it says there is no root access (after several times of SU saying I granted root for this app).Again, I need those photos.
