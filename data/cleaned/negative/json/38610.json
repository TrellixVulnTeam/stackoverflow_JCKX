I would like to know whether it is possible to not simply search for my avahi-enabled computer, but also to ssh to it via my ssh-android-terminal.I'm also referring to this question asked on Ubuntu forumsFrom my iPad it is possible to ssh to my Ubuntu machine, but what is missing on android-side to enable this for android? Do I have to install some kind of bonjour-service or similar?The thing is:I sure could install a full dns-service on my Ubuntu, but I wanted to know whether I could simply use avahi\/zeroconf instead. As I said above: with an iPad it us possible to connect to my Ubuntu machine by simply entering in ssh-terminal as host\/IP: MyHostName.localSo my question still is: why is this not possible with android? Sure I could use a zeroconf-browser-app that resolves the .local-adress to the actual IP. But that would be an extra step to make which is not needed on iOS... the ssh-terminal app on iOS can resolve .local itself! So do I need a terminal app that can do same? Until now I tried almost all, there aren't so many...I hope this explains my issue a bit better.And I don't think my question has been answered somewhere else before, as far as I can tell.I'm not sure on how to proceed... Should I append my question to another question? Or is it just my bad explanation? :\/Thanks in advance for your help!",
