    "Body":"Is there any android app which turns off completely the wifi radio, when the phone is locked AND the screen turns off.I have already tested some apps for this purpose and they solely rely on the screen turning off, which makes sense at some point. But their concept breaks down when you want to use an app over WiFi which as the capability to turn-off the screen due to the proximity sensor (think of the VOIP apps). Turning off the screen in that case means disconnection from the network.I need an app which will turn off the radio when the phone is locked, and won't rely on the screen being on\/offAny suggestions?[EDIT: I forgot to mention. I have already tried the built-in feature in Advanced Wi-Fi settings which shuts Wi-Fi off during sleep. It didn't seem to work. I was still able to ping the phone when locked, which means the Wi-Fi radio stayed on.]",
