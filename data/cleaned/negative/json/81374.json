    "Body":"Just wondering if there are any phones that support multiple bluetooth concurrent connections, such as a set of bluetooth headphones and a smartwatch, or a bleutooth keyboard and a smartwatch?I have a samsung s4 with AT&T and it doesn't seem that its possible to connect two bluetooth devices of any type at once. I'm sure what the coming wearable craze this will someday be possible, but I'm asking if there are any devices on the shelf today that support using multiple bluetooth devices at the same time. Thanks in advance!",
