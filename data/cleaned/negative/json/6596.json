    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  How can I install an app given only its APK file?  First, as I understand, if I do not have the SD card slot on Android phone (e.g. Samsung Nexus S), the only way that I can install the .apk file is to either download from Android Market or use the SDK (description is e.g. here http:\/\/www.talkandroid.com\/guides\/install-apk-files-on-android\/) and the USB cable (With SD card I'm copying the .apk to SD card and then I'm using the ASTRO file manager).Installation by sending .apk file over Bluetooth (like it is done on Symbian) is not possible, I guess - at least I was not able to send an .apk on any Android phone (the Bluetooth transfer was always rejected by the phone).How can I install an .apk file on an Android Phone which does not have a SD card slot?",
