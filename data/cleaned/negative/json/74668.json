    "Body":"My wife thinks that when I am on a business trip I stay at a different hotel than I told her, I stayed at a bar all night and left my car at the corporate office overnight. All of this is from looking at Google location history. From reading questions and answers posted here I think that I have some understanding of what is going on. Please review my explanation and critique\/correct. I need to be able to explain it to my wife so that it makes sense to her and gives some credibility to my explanations.My understanding of how Google location history works:Location services uses GPS, Wifi and cell I.D. to formulate your location.In order to save power it will use the least power hungry of the three options for determining your location.If your location is within the blue circle then Location history will not change your location i.e. show you in a restaurant all night if your hotel is also within the blue circle.Location services doesn't necessarily show your exact route... It will show a Wifi hotspot or cell tower that it \"hits\" and the \"route\" that you use will include these various locations. These locations will show that you have been to a variety of places that you never visited.Thank you for you help. It is very important to my wife and I that we get this cleared up.",
