    "Body":"A couple days ago I went into my camera gallery on my Motorola Atrix HD and noticed that all but four of my photos were gone. I cannot figure out how this happened?! I definitely did not delete them myself, and they have not been moved anywhere else.I'm thinking it might be an app I downloaded that wiped these or an automatic update, but not really sure.The weird thing is only my camera photos and videos are gone (except for four recent photos), but all my Instagram and Facebook photos and any downloaded photos are still in those corresponding folders. It seemed to only touch my Gallery folder (the photos were saved in my phone's internal memory).I really wish I could figure out a way to get these back, but so far, I'm not having any luck!I did a back-up in August so at least I have the majority of my photos, but I still lost a couple hundred since then.I tried using recovery software on my PC but the big issue I am having with it is that my phone doesn't use USB mass storage, so when I try to connect it to a computer via USB, it only uses MTP, and does not actually come up as a drive, so the recovery software does not see it, and basically that whole idea is useless.Does anyone know any way around this? I've already spent hours looking for possible answers and advice, but nothing has seemed to help. I tried restarting my phone too but that didn't help either. Should I go to the AT&T store to see if they can help? If anyone knows of things to try, or if this has happened to you and you might be able to tell me how it happened or how to get them back, please let me know :)Thank you!",
