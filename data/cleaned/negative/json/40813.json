    "Body":"I am sure many people have noticed that in the stock keyboard (Android 4.2 in my case) has more language layouts than it supports predicting. For many languages a dictionary \/ corpus is missing.So since it is rather easy to build a corpus, I wanted to add my own dictionary for some languages which have no official dictionary. But I cannot find any solution. Has this been achieved before?Note: Adding the words 1 by 1 is not a solution. :-)If there was a solution, many people would be helped I guess. Thanks for any help and hint given!",
