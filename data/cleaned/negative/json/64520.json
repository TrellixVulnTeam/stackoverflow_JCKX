    "Body":"This is kinda the inverse of what lots of people seem to be asking.It really annoys me when i'm in a city and my Android connects to every and any wi-fi hotspot whether or not they require login, and whether or not there is internet access available on them. I then find myself endless frustrated that there's no connection, wondering why. Why- if there is no internet connection through wi-fi, doesn't the system simply ignore that connection and connect through the mobile network.OK I could simply turn wi-fi off, but that would mean forever toggling it on and off, and on a least one occasion having done this I've forgotten to turn it back on and wondered why I've gobbled up my data allowance.Is there a setting I've missed somewhere, or a prioritising app?",
