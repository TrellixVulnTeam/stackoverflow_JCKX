    "Body":"Has anyone experienced this weird problem with the Android Market when accessing on the phone.Firstly, I'm in Australia, so expect prices for apps to be shown in AUD, but when I first open the Market on my phone...The 'featured' listing prices are in pounds.When viewing say the 'games' list, a search list or drilled down to a specific app, prices are in AUD (but some with incorrect amounts)When going \"directly\" to an app (eg. search 'Doodle Jump') price is listed as 99c (even though on the web-market it shows 10c)Instead of doing a search, if I browse through the game-list and then going into 'Doodle Jump' it shows as 10c...I've cleared market cache and forced stopped it... still see the same problems :Sps. Android Market on the web works fine for me, but just a bit puzzled by the on the phone behaviour.pps. price of 10c is from the 10 billion apps promotion thing Google has going on.",
