This seems like a trivial thing to do, but it is not working for me.Following the guide at http:\/\/forum.xda-developers.com\/showthread.php?t=2760965 i attempted to change the package name, but the line 'cur_package_name' and 'orig_package_name' are not in my apktool.yml, and there is an additional 'original-package' entry in the androidmanifest alogside the line with the package attribute.Also, upon doing the find-replace trick with notepad++ that they mentioned, it is unable to find any occurrences.Where can I go from here? I attempted to recompile and run the app on the tablet, but it force closes immediately as something is incomplete. Is there a version of this app that is already modded for side by side loading out there? or how can I proceed?",
