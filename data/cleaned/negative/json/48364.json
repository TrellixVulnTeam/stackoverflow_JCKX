    "Body":"I have a Samsung Galaxy SII plus. In the package I also got earphones from Samsung. The problem is that those earphones are in-ear, and they don't fit me well. I was wondering if there are 3rd-party earphones with the same capabilities (a pause\/play button is what I like the most, but volume control and a microphone are also welcome) that is not too expensive. I could only find earphones with that capabilities for iPhones, so is there a way to some transform this input so android can read it? I would really like your advice on this matter, thanks in advance!",
