I recently asked the question whether it was possible to transfer 2 files between two ICS devices here.This leads to the question:  How do I transfer files between two ICS-devices using WiFi Direct?  Is there a way to do it built-in to ICS, or is there an app for it?UPDATE:The Samsung Galaxy S II apparently has this feature built in pre-ICS (go samsung!). Is this same method available in ICS?",
