    "Body":"I've had my Galaxy Note about 18 months. It's progressively getting slower and slower to respond to user input. Any tap has an unpredictable delay, up to a few seconds. Even typing has a noticeable lag to it. I frequently accidentally tap things twice because there's no response to the first tap.Is there anything I can do? I'd happily completely wipe and start over at this point. It's at the stage where I barely use it for things like quickly looking up stuff on the net - it's just too tedious.It's the stock Samsung Android 4.1.2. 350 MB free on the internal storage out of 2GB, 830MB free out of 11GB on the USB storage, and 1.7\/14.7GB free on the memory card.Any suggestions gratefully received.",
