    "Body":"I have deleted some files by mistake on my Android mobile, and I'd like to get them back. I tried using Dr. Fone, but it brought me A LOT of documents and images back which are not even deleted, for example it showed me icons used in Viber, icons used in Skype. It showed ALL documents even non deleted. And on top of that, when I tried to recover a document, it asked me to pay and so on. I'd like to have a free solution for this.I tried an App called: Undeleter, but it asked me to if my device is rooted or not, and it told me that my device does not appear to be rooted. (I don't know what rooted means). What should I do? I am an absolute beginner and any hint is appreciated. Thanks. ",
