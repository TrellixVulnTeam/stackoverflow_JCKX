    "Body":"I have been searching for quite a while and can't find anywhere to download JUST the STOCK google android recoveries for Nexus 5. I'm looking for the LMY47I recovery.img to be specific. I dont see why I have to download the entire zip from google if I only want the recovery.img. Does anyone have a link or somewhere to download these files? If not I think I'm going to host my own as this could be very useful for people in my situation.Thanks in advance. Sorry if my google skills are -3 but I have seriously been looking for quite a while and haven't found anything so far.",
