    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Does constant charging harm my Android cellphone?  Indeed, this is a duplicate of: Does constant charging harm my Android cellphone?Just for the record -- let's say I leave phone charging for 8 hours, it will charge to 100% in 2 hours, so for the last 6 hours would be over charging.I used dumb phones (Nokias) this way for years, and nothing bad happened. I did it few times with Samsung Galaxy Ace 2, but after I heard some rumor it could damage the phone I try to disconnect the phone once it reaches 100%. Yesterday after 5 minutes of over charging the battery dropped from 100% to 77% in few hours in pure stand-by mode (no net, no gps, no calls, nothing, just waiting for action).No wonder I am now afraid of the battery life and also interested in getting facts. So far I found only just statements -- in case of iPhone \"overcharging means no harm\", in case of Android \"oh God, no, it will ruin your battery\".So -- can over charging damage battery? I am only interested in facts (no \"no\/yes\" answers please, explanation \"why\" is needed here) and\/or also long-standing experience.I am interested in this issue, because as developer I will connect phone to computer for longer than 2 hours, and charging is unavoidable.",
