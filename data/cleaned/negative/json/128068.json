    "Body":"The problem I'm having with my Samsung Galaxy Core Prime is that it keeps pocket dialing 911 in the lock mode. I'm not doing anything different but when I take it out of my pocket, I see that it dialed 911 and they are trying to call me back.Other than that I really like this phone, but this is the first time that something like this has happened on any of the smartphones that I've used. I've only had this phone for a couple of weeks and I really like the features for the price, other than the 911 calls.Any suggestion?",
