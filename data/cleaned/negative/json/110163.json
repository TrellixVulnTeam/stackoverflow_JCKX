    "Body":"How can I upgrade the OS of my Samsung Galaxy Exhibit (SGH-T599N) from Android 4.1 to 4.4 or higher?I am trying to install Live on YouTube \u2013 by Xperia on my smartphone so that I can live stream videos on YouTube, but it's giving me this error message: \"This app is incompatible with your device.\" According to the app's Google Play homepage, which was updated last week, the app requires Android 4.4 or higher. I only have 4.1. :( So, I assumed it must be because of that (please correct me if this assumption might be wrong.) Also, when I press Software Update on my device, I get: \"This device is up to date.\" Could it mean that I may never be able to update it anymore because it's too old?",
