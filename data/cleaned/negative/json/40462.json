    "Body":"I am considering using tablets for use with clients at my job and I was just wondering if there is anyway to lock users into one application. Just for theoretical purposes the application could be as simple as a sign in sheet where people would check in when they come into the buildings. what I want to disable is people's abilities to get out of the application(hitting the home button, et cetera). Basically I don't want people to have access to anything besides the sign-in application.Everything I've read points to this not being possible but I figure this is the best place to ask.Thanks in advance.",
