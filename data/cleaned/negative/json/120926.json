    "Body":"I have a phone with an SD card slot.  The internal storage is partitioned into two such that if I go to Settings >> Storage it shows 3 storage areas: Phone Storage , Internal SD and External SD.I don't use the Internal SD since the external SD card is always installed. Its where I place all files, music and videos. I consider the internal SD to be wasted space since its never used. I would like to have more space to install my apps.Is it possible to repartition the internal storage if I root? Heck, can I delete the Internal SD partition and just have two storage areas: Phone and External SD?",
