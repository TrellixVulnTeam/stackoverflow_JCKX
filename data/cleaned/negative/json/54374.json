When my phone is in 14% or below, it will tell me that I already need to charge but when I turn off my phone and turn it on again, it will go back to 16%. Also when my phone is already 100% charged and I turn it off and on again, it will be at 95% left. Can overcharging destroy a Xperia J or Android phone?",
