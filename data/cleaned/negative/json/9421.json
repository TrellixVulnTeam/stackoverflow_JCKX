    "Body":"I have some crazy ideas about some stuff lately but to make it tangible I need a bit more information over the capacitive touch screens.Is there a way to create an object that can be sensed by a capacitive touch screen without the touch of the human skin?I mean, imagine a tiny piece of something that you can just lay on the screen and the screen thinks is a finger or a stylus.I've heard about the stylus that can be sensed, but I think that the skin has to be touching it in order to work.. is it true? Can I maybe create something out of ordinary house stuff that can do this, without the need of the skin to touch it?Ahh, and by the way, it need to be capacitive because multi-touch is needed.Thank you all and best regards!",
