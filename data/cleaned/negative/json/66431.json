    "Body":"If I buy a phone that has the android OS 4.1 on it, can I upgrade to kitkat (4.4)?   The reason I'm asking is I currently have a froyo os version of android and I wanted to buy a newer phone for just development purposes.  I didn't want to shell out 500 bucks for a new phone or possibly tablet since I will only be using the phone for development purposes.  Or if anyone knows a tablet or phone that is able to do this that isn't hundreds and hundreds of dollars.",
