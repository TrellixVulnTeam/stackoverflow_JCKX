I've had very little contact with Android before.I know the name of the app and have tried to search the \"internal storage\" that shows up in explorer when I connect it but no apk file with the app name shows up.I also tried logging into the shell using adb, but I have no \"find\" command and no permission to list \"\/data\/\" where the apk files are supposed to be.I'd really appreciate if someone could help me out here!
