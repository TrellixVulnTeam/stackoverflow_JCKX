I discovered later that the car has bluetooth connectivity too, so you can gauge my level of expertise in this area!I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 (and very happy with it). I can call the iphone and everything is fine.However, when my wife calls me (from the iphone to Galaxy S2), the call does not come through. There is no ringing etc. It is as if nothing has happened. And this drives me crazy!The two phones are with the same provider, so the calls between the two phones are free for 5 minutes. Can anyone resolve this mystery? (I understand Apple's and Samsung's operating systems are different but at least two phones should be able to communicate with each other)."
