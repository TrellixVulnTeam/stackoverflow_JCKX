    "Body":"I own a Samsung Galaxy S III (rooted).My phone recently fell out of my car and was ran over multiple times before I could recover it.  The phone still works. I can turn it off and on (sound and vibrate work) but the screen is completely useless.  The back and the settings key both light up when I press the home key, but they do nothing and I can see nothing on the entire screen.What I want to know is, I have business texts on my phone that I need to save. Is there a way to pull (or copy) the messages from my phone to my computer?P.S.  I attempted using Wondershare Dr.Fone, but it will not work as I need to allow the application superuser access via the phone, which I cannot do because the screen does not work.I am unsure whether the USB debugging is on or off. I have been looking at other questions related to this one, but most of them involve the touch aspect of the screen still workingThank you all in advance.",
