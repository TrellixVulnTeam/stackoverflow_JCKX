    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Can I train Google Voice Actions to better recognize my voice?  The app cannot recognize my last name - therefore eliminating my extensive family from any voice-activated actions.  The name is similar to several other words one would encounter everyday, so I get why the app is having a hard time.  There are other words it also will not recognize (names, mostly) that are not readily confusable with common words.I speak english in the typical American way and am on an HTC Thunderbolt.I have downloaded the Voice Actions update and activated the Personalized Recognition setting but this seems only to learn what I do often vs learn what I am saying.Curiously, I have found that in the case of the name \"Maureen\", when I speak the command \"Send Text to\", Voice Actions will recognize \"Maureen\" in the body text but not in the address field.  I have even gone so far as to eliminate the last name from some contacts (in the contacts app) in order to remove the confusing part of the name.  This has not helped even once.Advice?  Did I miss a function that would solve the problem?",
