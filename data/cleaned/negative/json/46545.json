    "Body":"I have two unlock security options set up on my phone (HTC One). Firstly there is the facial recognition (which works well and lets me in) but on the occasions when it is too dark \/ doesn't recognise my face then it falls back to pattern unlock. However, I have no idea what this pattern is as I set it up ages ago and the facial recognition works quite well so I've not had to use it.I can get into the phone fine with face unlock, and can get to the security settings, but I can't change anything without first having to enter my unlock pattern.If I can't reset this pattern that means I can't ever shave or change my haircut for fear of not being recognised by the phone!Can I disable \/ reset the pattern security from within the phone? I have also got AirDroid set up on my laptop so that might open another route if I can't do anything from the phone itself.",
