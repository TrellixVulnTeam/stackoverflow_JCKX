My application is installed as I see an icon that I can invoke to launch successfully my application.  I also see a file: \/data\/app\/com.mydomain.myapp-36.apk however, if I try to invoke that file from the shell I get an error of can't execute: permission denied, even though I am root.  I notice that for sshDroid, I can invoke it from the shell using the path: \/data\/data\/berserker.android.apps.sshdroid\/dropbear\/ssh but I find no corresponding path for my application \/data\/data\/com.mydomain.myapp\/ as that directory only contains the subdirectories: cache, files, and lib.Is there something I can do when building on installing my application so that my application can be invoked from the shell, or do I just need help locating the pathname for my application?",
