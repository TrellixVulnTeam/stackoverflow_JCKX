    "Body":"I have a Huawei Ascend G6, which uses a 32GB SD card to store most app data. I now bought a Huawei Y6 to migrate to and want to retain as much app data as I can. How would I go about to transfer my apps (data) to the new device?The Y6 has Lollipop, so when booting the device, I was asked which apps to install. So I got all apps installed now. So how do I go about transferring configuration data? I assume I can't just put my SD card into the Y6 and be done with it?",
