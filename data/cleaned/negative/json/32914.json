I have been trying to understand how to solve my phone's problem by reading threads\/questions dealing with this problem. However, I cannot interpret the techno-babble. Apparently, I need to 'root' my phone, but I also saw it wasn't for the 'faint-hearted,' of which I am one.Could someone please direct me to a guide that can explain this process in the easiest terms? Where do I start, how do I proceed, what programs\/operating systems do I need, etc. I don't even know what questions to ask at this point. All I know is that my phone has progressively run out of space, despite my deleting everything I can. It's now running very sluggishly and reboots on its own, and I have to take the battery out often to reset it, etc.I just don't have the know-how or time to sift through all the threads\/websites discussing this. Can someone please help?Thanks so much!",
