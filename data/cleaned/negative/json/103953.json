I read that before posting. Firstly this is showing a point where I have been before very often (a house of mine 200 km away where I have last been in December) not just a random faulty point. The answers to the previous question speculated about GPS accuracy and this is clearly not the same issue. You should investigate in more detail before simply marking something as duplicate."
