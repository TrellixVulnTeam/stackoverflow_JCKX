    "Body":"I have been using Gameboid for a long time in landscape on my phone, but since I got my N7, I've been playing in portrait mode instead of landscape. The problem now is that the L and R buttons are much too far away to reach, and there is no way to move them. I looked at My Boy!, but it doesn't have that capability either, and for that matter doesn't even support portrait mode. Is there any emulator which does have the ability to move the controls?",
