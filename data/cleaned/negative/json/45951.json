The widget works completely fine but the problem i have is that android caches my no-ip hostname and since i have dynamic dns on my personal computer, i can't communicate with my computer unless i have no-ip or a similiar service.For example this is what i get when i ping from my personal computer: http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OwODAfT.png And this is what i get when i start my widget:http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YNELuBS.pngHow can i prevent this from happening and make my widget work with the ip which i get from pinging the domain from my pc.",
