    "Body":"Samsung Galaxy S RelayAndroid 4.4.4Cyanogenmod 11I've tried many different solutions to sync my phone's SD cards with a computer over Wi-Fi, leaving them to run overnight because there's so much data (~30 GB), but in the morning the phone is slow and unresponsive, warm to the touch, apps like Gentle Alarm don't work, etc.  It becomes so slow that when I try to use it, it eventually stops responding completely and reboots itself.  I've tried:FolderSyncSyncthingSamba on phoneFTP server on phoneSSHDroid on phone and SyncBack on computerAt first I assumed it was because the apps were flawed, so I tried different solutions, but now I'm thinking it's a more fundamental OS problem, like accessing too many files at a time or sending too much data over the network causes the phone to become unstable?  Maybe a memory leak or it opens files and never closes them or something?  How can I diagnose this and make it workable?  When I look at CPU\/memory usage, it seems normal?  (Though it reboots while I'm trying to check, so a CPU\/memory usage logger would be better.)",
