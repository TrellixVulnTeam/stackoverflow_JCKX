Every time I update an app, it is moved to storage and i have to move it to sd card again.Is there an app that move other apps to SD automatically after updates? I had link2sd and purchased the paid version long ago for a rooted s3 mini, but i don't find link2sd useful anymore. App2SD is just an interface for moving apps, it can't move apps automatically.If you want to know why I don't want to root, here, actually I want to root but there are no rooting safe rooting tools for my phone right now.",
