    "Body":"A friend recently bought a Blusens Touch 96 tablet as a Christmas present for her father. The specs are here.Short version: 9.7 inches, Android 4.1, Cortex A9 processor, 1 Gb. RAM.Anyway, the tablet looked responsive and reasonably fast when tried in the store (opening apps, scrolling, etc.), but when he tried to connect to the WiFi network things started to go wrong. The tablet was incredibly slow when doing anything online: it took us about an hour and 3-4 timeouts just to create a Google account. The simplest webpages take about 5 minutes or more to load. Meanwhile, and just as a test, I was trying to access the same pages with a laptop at my side, and there were no problems. All of this in the same room than  the Wifi router, at less than 5 meters of distance.We tried restarting the Wifi router, disabling autosync in the Google account (as per this post) and restarting the tablet, but nothing seemed to work. My friend is understandably miffed.My question is: is this a \"normal\" experience with a cheap, unknown-brand Android tablet? I have to admit that I don't own a tablet myself and don't know much about this market. I knew not to expect too much from cheap chinese-knockoff style products, but even this seemed too much for me.",
