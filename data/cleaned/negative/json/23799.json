    "Body":"I read many good reviews about the Droid Razr Maxx which mainly focused on its large 3300 mA battery. All reviews brag about how long the phone lasts before running out of power.Most reviews on Amazon speak highly of the phone too.HOWEVER, I came across this blog Droid Razr Maxx \u2013 Broken ScreenSurprisingly, a LOT of people are complaining about having cracks in their screens. Some admit that their phone fell to the ground, but many others say the screen cracked without falling.Does this have to do with the large 3300mA irremovable battery? I mean is this because of the battery heating up and expanding?Is this a flaw in Motorola's version of Ginger Bread?Note:AFAIK, the screen is made of Gorilla -unbreakable- glass, so I think most people mean the LCD screen cracked.UPDATEHere is another link from Verizon's forums about customers suffering from the same problem. Some of them say it wasn't dropped.",
