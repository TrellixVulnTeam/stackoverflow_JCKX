    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  How can I recover a deleted file on Android?  Is it possible to recover overwritten sound recordings from the default android sound recorder? Earlier I was recording some short responses in a focus group using the sound recorder, I kept the application open and stopped recording after each response, and re-pressed the record button for the next response and so on.Unfortunately, I thought this would save each recording and create a new file, I did not realise that this would overwrite the previous recording. Therefore I only currently have the most recent recording on my SD card.Is there any way of recovering the overwritten sound recordings? I think the answer is no, but I just wanted to make sure.
