One challenge I often run into is that I can connect to a WiFi network, and my friends with iPhone cannot (I've also encountered the opposite, but that's another topic). It seems the hotspot functionality only works with connection to a telephone network, and not as a regular WiFi-WiFi hotspot. Do any of you know of a built in functionality that will do this, or an app I can download that will solve this issue for me? Thanks :)",
