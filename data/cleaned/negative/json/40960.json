    "Body":"I have a Motorola Electrify M 4G through US Cellular and I received the 4.1 Jelly Bean update OTA nearly a month ago and I'm a bit eager to get the 4.2 version but I can't find anything online about a release date for my phone. I know 4.2 has been out for a while now and there's even people talking about getting the OTA update to 4.2.2 and even speculation on a release date for 5.0, Key Lime Pie. With each upgrade, I need fewer and fewer apps to make my phone work just right for me. From a built in task manager in ICS to notification widgets in the latest JB.  Anyway, I'm eager to get this update! Thanks!",
