    "Body":"Ok, I need someone smart on this because numerous \"techies\"including geek squad guys have not been able to solve this problem for me so far. While I have transferred photos, contacts etc. to my new Galaxy S5, the one file I miss most are all the wifi network locations and saved passwords accumulated over the years. I've seen responses skirting around this issue like, \"can't be done\" or \"need this app or that\", \"have to root your devices\", \"use the cloud\" on and on. Please, I need a step by step (for the non techie type) or for one that can read directions, On how to get these files off the old HTC Inspire and into the new Samsung Galaxy S5. I don't care where the files are, I just want them on my new device. Files have been backed up on the Inspire and am willing to root it if necessary but not the Samsung as it voids the warranty. Anyone have a proven clear step by step solution for this?",
