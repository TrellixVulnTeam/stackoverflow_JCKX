Now problem is that I want to test it in both landscape mode and portrait mode but I don't want to  keep on changing the orientation of phones every 5 minutes manually by myself. Is there any adb command or anything else by which I can tell the phone to change its orientation? Can I fool it by simulating acceleration or any other alternative?I am open to rooting but I prefer any solution which works on non-rooted phones.",
