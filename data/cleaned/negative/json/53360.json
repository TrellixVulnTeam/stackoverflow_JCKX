    "Body":"I'm actually playing the Chinese version of Plants vs Zombies 2 because the English (or international?)  version is not released yet. I don't have idea about Chinese and as you would guess, sometimes is a real pain in the arse, but in the meantime is fine for me, so I'm planning to change it to the English version when that will be out.But I'm worried about losing all my progress from the Chinese version or maybe cannot copying it to the English version. In the best case, where the saved data is the same for both versions, how should I copy it from one version to another? My cellphone should be rooted or should be so simple as copy some files from one folder to another with any file explorer? Is there a chance that all my data is actually stored in the EA servers?I don't know if somebody already had an experience like this one with another game\/application in general and how much feasible should be.",
