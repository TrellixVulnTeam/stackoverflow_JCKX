I have used CM7. CM9, CM10 and MIUI. I really like MIUI v4 and above, but i haven't found any MIUI v4 ROM that is stable enough for daily basis. I really like ROMS that has kind of flat buttons as seen in the metro UI and ics and above roms. I like it professional with not like big really graphic intense UI's. I have searched a lot, and i have looked into the Prada rom for the LG Optimus 2X, but i couldn't find a download link. Do anyone of you have a ROM that is fast, professional and stable enough for daily basis? Thanks",
