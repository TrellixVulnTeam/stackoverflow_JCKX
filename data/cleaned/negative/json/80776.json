It started downloading, and at 96% it stopped and said I don't have enough memory.I wont try to download it again, but that 96% that I downloaded is still in my phone and I cant delete it. Can someone tell me how? I went into options then applications, but there is no that game that I can delete. I tried to find it many times but it is not there.",
