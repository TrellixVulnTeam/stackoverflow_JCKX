    "Body":"I have a Sony Xperia U running Android 4.0.4 ICS. The problem is that it runs really slowly. It is particularly bad while multi-tasking. While listening to music, if I get a phone call, it hangs. Vibrator starts but the ringtone doesn't. The \"Incoming Call\" screen doesn't come up, etc.Has anyone used this phone with Gingerbread? If so, how was their experience?I followed the steps in here, but my Battery Monitor says 43% Screen and 23% Android OS, which isn't really helpful! Are there any particular apps that are responsible for this?Why is ICS slow on this device? I mean, 1.0 GHz dual core and 512 MB of RAM is not less!edit: The first thing I did after buying it was to upgrade it to ICS via Sony PC Companion. The phone has been like this ever since. I phoned Xperia Support and also did a Firmware Repair (again via PC Companion) and a Factory Reset, but it's no use.",
