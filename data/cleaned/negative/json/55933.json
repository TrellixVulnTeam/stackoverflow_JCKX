I noticed it happens mostly on the part where the letter 'e' is, when i'm holding the phone in landscape mode.So, i did a factory reset, wiped out SD card as well during the factory reset, and the problem still persists.It sometimes happens for a certain period of time, and it starts to work after a while.I did a line drawing test, and on some places it doesn't draw the line correctly (it is continuos but it's drawn with sharp angles, i don't know how to explain it better).I read somewhere it is most probably a hardware problem, with a digitizer. Is there any way to be sure, or is it best to take it to a repair shop?",
