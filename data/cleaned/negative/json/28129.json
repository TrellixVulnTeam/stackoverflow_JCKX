We all know as to how to connect our android phone with our laptop so as to use our laptop's internet connection in our android phone.But my question is how to be directly connected to internet on the laptop and connect my Samsung Galaxy Y mobile to it, so as to use the laptop's internet connection in the mobile.Reason: Why I need to do that.I Live in the country of India. MTS was the first country to launch 3G Plug-and-Play Modems in India. I have one of those. The device has a direct connection and does not requires insertion of a SIM card. I can connect it to my Laptop and use the internet service, but it is not possible to connect it to the mobile phone.P.S: Fell free to migrate it to SuperUser if you guys think it belongs there.",
