I then enabled adb root with the adbd insecure app by Chainfire. It would appear that everything is good to go but when I run Droid Explorer with the tablet plugged in and USB debugging on, it appears to load correctly but then I do not have access to any files or folders. All I see on the left-hand side is a file labeled \"\/\" but I cannot actually open it and it shows \"0 objects\" at the bottom. I would really appreciate some help here, thanks.",
