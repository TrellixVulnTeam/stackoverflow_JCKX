    "Body":"Under the suggestion of xkcd, and the following Blog, which suggests shutting off the computer after finishing a task, I began turning my Galaxy S6 to Ultra Power Savings Mode when I finish a task.  This allows me to receive phone calls and messages, but stops the addicting games.  This definitely seems to stop the phone addiction.  But, after reading the article from Randall, who mentions instant bootup laptops among other things that make these kind of methods difficult.  This leads to two questions:1.) Has anyone else had success in trying this method to reduce phone use when social pressures demand a stop to phone use?2.) Is there any method or device or app or anything known that would add a programmed delay feature to the bootup of Ultra Power Savings Mode, for this purpose?  If not, I would use my remaining rep on this site to ask for a bounty for someone to program such a method - let me know if interested.",
