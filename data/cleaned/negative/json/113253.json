    "Body":"So I'm an avid Android user and developer. I, for the most part, really like the platform - all its extensibility\/customizability\/freedoms.That being said, having worked with iPhones and Windows Phones - they're just smoother. All the animations seem to play smoothly without jank, they never seem to really drop frames, everything just seems a bit quicker.Why is this?I know that Android uses Java which is garbage collected, but my understanding is that Java is only a little bit slower than C so I don't see that being the real limiter.I also know that Android has to optimize for all device sizes\/configurations - and I'd be ready to believe that as a result view rendering\/hierarchy determination is less efficient and that's causing most of the lag, but Windows Phone also has this issue, right?Maybe it's just rogue services that accumulate over time? I'm at a bit of a loss.Once again - I love Android. Some views rendering slowly\/animations being choppy are far outweighed to me by the rest of the positives of the ecosystem. I'm interested as both a developer and a user about the slowness though.Thanks guys!Note: I've been using a Nexus 5 for the past year or so. I've used the S3\/S4\/S5 as test devices, as well as a myriad of older phones. This post is mainly a question about top-of-the-line android phones.",
