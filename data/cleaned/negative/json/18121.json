How am I supposed to start a chat with someone if I don't know who is online and who is offline?I started a conversation with a friend (who ended up being offline even though I couldn't tell).

If my friends started a hangout, how would I join it unless I was specifically invited to it?It seems like this shouldn't be so complicated. The interface certainly isn't complicated, so maybe I'm missing something?",
