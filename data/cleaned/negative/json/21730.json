    "Body":"I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.1, running Android 3.2, which I've rooted.When I plug it in by USB to my Ubuntu computer, it looks like this:There's about 24 or so directories, all numbered as shown in the image. As far as I can tell, they don't correspond to any directories actually on the device, and I can neither find any files I think should be on the device or transfer any files to the device. (To be accurate: I can copy files to one of the weirdly numbered directories, but then I can't find them if I try to look for them from the tablet interface.)What's going on, and, more importantly, how do I get a normal connection to my tablet so I can transfer files back and forth?Update 1: I have learned this is probably \"MTP mode\". I can't seem to find any option to disable or change it.Update 2: I have tried turning \"USB debugging\" both on and off, and neither way seems to make a difference.Update 3: I've asked about this issue also on the Ubuntu SE site, in case part of my problem is on the Ubuntu side.Update 4: Here's another error message I get if I try to use mtpfs to connect to the Android device:",
