I have been using my Bose QC15 to listen to music and it has headphone controls but unlike the iPhone I cannot change the volume, switch songs (I can but it pauses more than switching) go back a song, fast-forward, or rewind with the headphone controls. I find it rather troublesome because I have to fish out my phone and get into the music app to do most of that. Any help on this?",
