    "Body":"I have a sony xperia neo. I usually had atleast 110-135 mb free in my phone memory. Whatever new apps I install I always move them to sd if it is possible to do so for that app. I also keep clearing the cache for every app almost once a week, infact I also clear the app data ocassionaly when I think the data is unnecessary. Recently, my phone's internal storage just reduced by itself. All by itself. I did not install any new app, infact I actually deleted some. Obviously I did not move any apps back into the phone memory. Yea, some apps like YouTube, Officesuite, Adobe Reader etc. that come pre-installed in the phone memory were updated recently bur these updates obviously weren't big enough to take up all that memory. I even un-installed updates on apps like fb which are on the phone memory n which I don't use often. From having over 100Mbs of internal storage, today I have between 35-25 Mbs available. Why?? Where did all that memory disappear?? How can I fix this?! Please Help.Note: 1. I have viber, its moved to sd. Lately, the viber photos folder in the gallery has started having blank 0kb photos in thousands, all by itself. I have 5k photos in that folder of which 4.9k are blank and appeared there all by itself. Could this be a reason why the phone memory got so low, even though viber is in sd? If not, why is this happening anyway?I have avg antivirus (free). My phone is scanned automatically every week.I did not root my phone. ",
