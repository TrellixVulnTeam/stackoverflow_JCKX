    "Body":"From a layman point of view, one would say, \"Oh, I'm unrooted so I am blocked and access is not allowed.\" I want the programmatic point of view; telling me how an unrooted device doesn't have access to the whole filesystem, etc., and how a rooted device has that access.Examples:1.Is the filesystem set by default to disallow reads\/writes to \/system, \/sys, \/data, etc.? 2.Is there something stored in \/system or \/data (such as a program, block device\/file, etc.) that the unrooted OS runs that limits system-wide access on several tasks that rooted users have?3.Does the default \"unrooted\" OS actually have system-wide prevention of unrooted access?Because look at it this way: to \"root\" your device something must be changed, right? So the \"rooting program\" or process must entail how this restriction is circumvented. Does anyone here\/can anyone link to anything (or explain it) that explains this process of how the rooting progress allows users access they weren't normally given by default (programmatically; not details on steps to follow in a rooting process and not info on how to root on your phone from a user's point of view; from a developer's point of view). Best example: Say I'm an Android developer and I wish to learn how to create a rooting program. What would I, for example, need to know to do this?",
