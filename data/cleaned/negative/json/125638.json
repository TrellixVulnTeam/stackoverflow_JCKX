Some I can install and then move to the Sd card but I was wondering if there is a way to make it so the apps auto install of the sd card, and possibly how to force some apps to move into the sd card? [WhatsApp for example can't be moved but I'd preffer it was in the card:\/ ]Also, is there a way to know in advance if the app will be moveable into the sdcard? Ex: Before installing Whatsapp could I have know it couldn't be moved?I thank in advance for any response :)",
