This is in the stock e-mail app that comes with Android.

Is there a way to prevent this?Obviously in corporate settings the mail servers have been setup to show if a person is online or not, but I'm talking about personal e-mail accounts, for example my yahoo shows a green dot beside e-mails from a gmail. How can I prevent others from seeing I'm online?I don't know if this is an android specific question because I'm using Outlook on my PC and if it does work in the same way I wouldn't want others to know when I'm online.
