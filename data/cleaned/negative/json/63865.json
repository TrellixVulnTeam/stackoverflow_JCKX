First, I tried killing the background process, but I still get skype messages, for example. Then, I tried to force quit the application, but when something triggers it, it loads again!For now, I decided to uninstall it and install it whenever I want to actually use it. But the lack of respect is really annoying. And my feeling is that it's intentional, not a bug.Anyway... Has anyone found something that really works, except installing a firewall or installing another application that will specifically kill skype?Thanks and sorry for asking a question that has already been asked...",
