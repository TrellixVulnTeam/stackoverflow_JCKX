    "Body":"I like everything about my new Samsung Note 3. It is a superior device in almost every respect to my previous phone the iPhone 5.But, I have one issue that I have not yet resolved. I cannot get the level of detail notifications that are automatically shown in a rolling notification queue like the iPhone (see images below, iPhone on left, Android on right). The notifications are shown in the queue in the order they are received regardless of source (sms, email, calendar notification, etc).  They are scrollable vertically, and a swipe takes you to that specific message, event, email, etc.This is one area the iPhone did very well, and I relied on the timeliness and dependability of that feature. I have downloaded several lockscreen and notifications apps, but none are close to what I described. Any suggestion?  I really appreciate any insight. Thanks",
