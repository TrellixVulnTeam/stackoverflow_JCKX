    "Body":"I've bought a Samsung Galaxy Duos GT-S7562 with Android 4.0.4 3 months ago. The phone is so slow and getting slower by the ay, it has become almost useless. For instance, to look up and call a contact can take more than a minute. Some apps simply won't start, nor work and prefer crashing. I can literally count to 3 between the moment I click to take a picture and the moment the camera will actually take the picture.I haven't found a solution to this on Internet so far. The only thing I can think of is tossing the phone on a wall, but somehow I think that won't help.How can I make my phone be worth the 200$ I paid for again?  ",
