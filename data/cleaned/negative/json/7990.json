When I get a navigation instruction I want the audio book to pause, then resume where it left off.Google navigation just mutes every audio book player I've found (doesn't pause\/resume), NDrive (preferred) just plays over the top of the audio book.I've tried AudioBook player 2 (free) and MortPlayer (Audio Book).Ideally I'd like to continue to use NDrive and find an audiobook player that works with it, but if that's not possible any combination of navigation \/ audiobook player would do.In case it matters I'm in the UK and am using an HTC Wildfire (i.e. small screen resolution).",
