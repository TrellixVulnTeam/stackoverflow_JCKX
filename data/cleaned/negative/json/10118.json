    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  How can I prevent Google Talk from disconnecting?  I have a droid 2 running Android 2.2. Google talk always seems to have issues. I've re-formatted my phone and started from scratch in addition to playing with all available settings, but it still loses connection to the server constantly. Or at least it says it lost connection. I can still send and receive messages despite this notice.It often loses connection to the server in the middle of a conversation with a friend. It then says \"Soandso is offline. Messages will be sent when online.\" or something to that affect. When the friend replies I will get the android notification in the notification bar containing their reply, but my open chat window will not update until I back out to the buddy list and re-enter the conversation, then the offline message goes away for a second and shows me the updated conversation. But it quickly goes back to saying offline again.Anyone know why this app has so many issues? My friend has an android phone as well and it does the same thing. Does anyone else have this issue? If so, has anyone been able to resolve it?",
