I moved to a Motorola phone (which is closer to original Android) and it not all contacts are linked correctly due to the following problems:Some of my contacts have non-English names and in some places they use the diminutive (think Robert\/Bob). I would like to link them.I know bilingual people who in some places use the different form of their names. In one case it is even different alphabet.Is it possible to link these contacts? How can I do it?",
