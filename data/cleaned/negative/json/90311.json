    "Body":"HTC One Mini 2\/Android 4.4.2\/HTC Sense 6.0\/Not rooted\/4 weeks oldA couple of days ago i encountered this message on my phone:UIDs on system are inconsistentYou need to wipe your data partition or your device will be unstable[I'm feeling lucky]  (button)...and then ensued a long day of tech support & research which i wanted to share here.  Web searching did not solve my problem directly, and while i can add a couple of insights that i didn't find elsewhere, i don't really have an answer.  Many of the information i found was from people who had rooted their phones, and therefore not directly relevant to me - i am approaching this from an un-rooted phone.Symptoms\/historyPhone crashed while browsing HTC's blinkfeed, and restartedIt limped along for a few minutes and restarted againPhone then gets stuck at white HTC\/android screen and remains there (left for several hours) - ie cannot power off, screen remains onLater, i discovered that you can proceed beyond this screen by ejecting the sim card - this then shows the lock screen (active background, time, date etc) but on top of this is the message UIDs on system are inconsistent... and one button which says \"I'm feeling lucky\".  Whether you can press the button seemed to be allowed if you changed the position of the sim card - (ie if out, push it in, if in, eject it).After dismissing the strange message, i am left with a black screen with notification bar at the top, and navigation bar at the bottom.  No apps; no widgets.  The notification bar was working, in that i could swipe down, enter settings etc.  Further, if i received a text, i could then access my messages via the notification bar, but could not reply to a text because the keyboard did not load.  Having used an app like messages or settings, i could switch between them with the bottom right navigation button as usual.  I found that i could receive phone calls, and once done so, i could dial others by switching back to the phone app.  This about sums up the functionality of the phone.The other comment was that the phone could not be switched off.  Holding down the power button and selecting power off simply resulted in a restart of the phone.After further investigation with HTC technical support i found i could restart the phone in safe mode, but exactly the same process happens (ie restart, ejecting and re-inserting the sim card and agreeing to the \"I'm feeling lucky\" button to get back to the main lock screen).  HTC technical support wanted me to do a hard reset: this can be done in one of two ways, by software (an option under settings>backup & reset>Reset phone) or by hardware (holding down volume-down and power during start up.  The software method had no effect on the described behavior.  We tried this several times.  The hardware method was unsuccessful, the phone simply restarted in safe mode.HTC technical support finally admitted defeat, unable to think of something else suggested sending it in for repair.  Vodafone tech support also offered to send a pack for returning the phone for repair.All comments\/further info from the community will certainly be interesting, but please also see below, as i did manage to avoid sending back the phone for repair as I did eventually succeed in the hard reset.",
