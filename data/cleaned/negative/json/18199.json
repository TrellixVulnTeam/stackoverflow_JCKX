    "Body":"Is there a task widget that only shows todays tasks?  I have a had  a few that I have downloaded, synced with my google account, and all was fine. I then added that task app as a widget and started completing tasks, and future tasks appear. For example, I have make;Make coffee (due 1-11-12)Make lunch (due 1-11-12)Do laundry (due 1-11-12)Make coffee (due 1-12-12)Make lunch (due 1-12-12)Now say I only see 3 tasks on the widget, so they all have a due date of 1-11-12. Great, all todays thing that need to be done, but as soon as I mark off make coffee, (due 1-11-12), it brings up make coffee (due 1-12-12), which I don't want. I only want to see todays tasks. Any help pointing me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!If possible, I'd like the widget to be about the size of the calendar so it doesn't take up the entire screen. I'd like to keep the task and calendar on the same screen.",
