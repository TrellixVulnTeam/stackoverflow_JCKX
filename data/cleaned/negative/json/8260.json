    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  Can I use the Google Market without syncing other Google data?  Hello,I'd like to setup a personal calendar with Funambol's syncing application. My goal is to never let my calendar items go on Google servers, for privacy reasons. But I do have Google Calendar application (from a stock ROM, so not easily uninstallable).From what I understand, Funambol Sync Client synchronizes with a system-wide calendar, the same which is used by Google Calendar client. Will this make my items sync with remote Google Calendar if I launch Google's client (f.e. by mistake)?I still want to use Google account for Market--and only for it. How can I enforce a no-synchronization rule only for calendar items?I think I could remove \/system\/app\/Calendar.apk (my phone is rooted), but doesn't Google services synchronize using GTalkService?",
