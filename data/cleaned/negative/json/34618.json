    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  How can I arrange the applications on each page of my app drawer?  When I click on the launcher icon (shown on the bottom right corner of the LCD screen as illustrated by Picture A), it will display the list of applications which are installed (as shown in Picture B).However, I notice that when one boots up the phone, some of the applications are shown and later when the SD card is fully mounted, the rest of the applications are then shown inside the launcher.So, I was wondering if it is possible to move the location of the applications inside the launcher to another page (assume if there are pages for one to move the applications) or other location in the same page.Please note that I am not referring to the applications shortcuts or creating applications shortcuts onto the screen of Picture A.Picture APicture B",
