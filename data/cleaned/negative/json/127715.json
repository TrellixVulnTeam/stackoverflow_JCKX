I also saw it when I was playing Clash of Clans and other games.How do I get rid of it? What applications have that ad?EDIT:I restored factory settings and an app tried to ask permission to send ads. I click cancel. After a while that app tried to ask permission again. I have no idea what ad it is.I did a factory reset. Now the ad is gone. However it is replaced by annoying permission request.The problem with the permission is it's not clear which app ask for that permission.Also, I do not think this question is a duplicate because I got the problem even after factory reset and I see that this app is supported by airpush notification. Obviously, as a user, I just want to delete the app. What app?Furthermore, I can't scan my Android. Every scanner, malware anti virus, airpush detector fails and crashes.I think some apps are embedded in my ROM. That's why the price is a bit cheaper.",
