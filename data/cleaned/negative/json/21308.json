I have consistent hanging\/speed issues with my Apps when I use WiFi compared to 3G.For instance, last night, I played a move with Word With Friends and the app said \"Sending Move...\".  It sat there for a while so, out of curiosity, I just turned the display off and went to bed.  When I turned the display on that morning, I still saw the \"Sending Move..\" screen.I closed the app, turned off WiFi (thereby enabling 3G) and then loaded WWF.  The move sent instantly.  Other WiFi apps do the same thing; Facebook for instance hangs constantly on WiFi.  Also, there are times I open up the browser and it responds with \"Can't connect\"...even though the icon at the top of my screen says I'm connected to WiFi.  Usually, if I take the battery out, put it back in, let the phone reboot, WiFi resumes back to normal.  However, this is cumbersome.I realize it could be a router issue though I have other devices connected to my router and they work fine 100% of the time. (One of the other devices is my wife's iPhone :P)Is there a way I can pinpoint what the issue is?Or, even better, have you had this problem and have a fix for it?",
