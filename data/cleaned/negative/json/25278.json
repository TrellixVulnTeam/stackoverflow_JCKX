Anyway, when i put the card back into my smartphone, it said \"Damaged SD card, you may need to reformat it\". When i clicked it down from my notification bar, it gave me the option to format my SD card, warning also of losing all my data. so i formatted it and it said \"erasing sd card\".. then it said \"Sd card is currently being checked\".. then nothing. Same \"damaged sd card\" message in my notifications bar. When i placed my microsd card into a SD card adapter and put it in my digital camera, nothing seemed wrong. my camera took pictures like normal and made no complaints about insufficient memory. (i put it in my camera just tot test how my camera would react). So, still wondering wtf is going.. i put the SD card adapter into my computer.. and it read normally. my computer fully recognized my microsd and the files, along with the pictures i had just taken on my digital camera. so i took it out and placed it back into my phone.. yet my phone still popped up with \"damaged sd card\" message. i put the card back into my computer and formatted it through my PC, with my PC saying it successfully reformatted my card.
