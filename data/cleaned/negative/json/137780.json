Once I received it I decided to reboot it to freshen it's memory unknowingly that I was gonna be prompted with this google verification startup menu. My problem here is that there are no OTG cables sold in our electronic shops and stores and want to know if there's another possible way to bypass the factory reset google verification. Your help would be of great appreciation. ",
