    "Body":"I need a browser that supports websocket and full screen mode and where I can set a default homepage.The device that I am using is Rikomagic MK802 III. I am using a startup program to open a browser in full screen mode with a default URL when the machine is booted.The default stock Android browser works fine, but does not support websocket. It also does not have a very good support for JavaScript.Next, I tried with Chrome, Firefox and Opera. All of them support websocket and works fine. But none of them have a provision to set a default homepage and full screen also is not supported.However I found an add-on in Firefox that supports full screen, but don't know how to make this a default behavior when the browser is opened. Setting default homepage is still a problem.Please suggest me what option I am left with. Is there any workaround ?",
