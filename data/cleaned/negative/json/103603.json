    "Body":"It must be noted that I know very little about programming, and don't even own an Android device, however I am considering building one(Learning whatever it takes.)My question is simply, if I were to build an android computer, using a development board such as the Odroid C1, is there a standard way, using any battery, that I could make a circuit to detect battery level and connect it to the board using IO pins, and report the level to the OS in a way that doesn't need a custom driver to be developed, so that the stock Android OS can display the battery level.  The purpose of this is so that if I were to replicate many of these computers, I could simply install the stock Android OS and it automatically detects the battery level, so that I would not have to install a custom driver on every single one.Everything I have asked may not make any sense, as I am not very familiar with android at all. I'm asking under the assumption that Android works similarly to a typical Linux OS.",
