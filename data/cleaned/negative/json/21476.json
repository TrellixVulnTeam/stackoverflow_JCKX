    "Body":"Okay, in spite of the hate being heaped on by iPhone elitists, I have installed Instagram on my Android phone and have started playing with it a bit.How can I get my Instagram photos to automagically appear in a public album in Google+ Photos?Felicia Day, for instance, has a public Instagram album.I can see, on my phone, an Instagram album (which was automatically created by the app), but there is no such album in my Google+ Photos. The options for the phone album do not include a \"make public\" option, and there's nothing in the Instagram settings. At best, the photos are appearing in the default \"Photos from your phone\" album.I know that I can manually share them, either through the website by making a public album and moving\/copying them there, or using the Share features on my Android, but I'd rather have something automatic.Is this possible, or just a pipe dream?(Cross-posted at Web Applications.)",
