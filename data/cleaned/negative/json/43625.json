What I would like to do is set it to access point mode and share my ADSL internet with my laptop through wifi.I would connect the phone via an usb cable and I would like to be able to route and share my pc's internet through it to and back from my laptop.I don't mind if the firmware must be changed as I have an other phone. But I prefer if there is easier\/more convenient way to do this. On the pcs I'm also flexible about OSes.How could I use my phone as an wifi adapter?EDIT To make it more clear, here is what I mean:I have:\"PC A\" with internet over ADSL. no wifi.my phone, it has an usb cable and a wifi chipset.\"PC B\" with wifiWhat I would like to do us to use PC A's internet on PC B, with the help of my phone.Connect Internet to PC A, then connect my phone to PC A, then connect PC B to my phone via Wifi, and use PC A's internet on PC B.Internet >>> Adsl modem >>> ethernet cable >>> PC A >>> USB cable >>> phone >>> wifi >>> PC B",
