    "Body":"  Possible Duplicate:  How to upgrade \/ swap SD card without losing data and installed apps?  I am about to switch to SanDisk 16GB SDHC from 8GB storage flash card of same brand, but currently have following problems:Sometimes Android OS forcecloses and restart fixes problem for a while:This happens again and again by touching back button until switched from application or a home button.Android Market v2.3.4 does not update apps:Apps that are set to update automatically are stuck at \"Downloading\" as progress meter does not move and i have to update manually by cancelling download which negates the point in automatic app update. Gets stuck at download progress bar but progress bar is animated. After cancelling automatic download, i can re-download again manually.Should aforementioned problems be taken care of before switching to a higher storage card or after? Additionally how would you go about rectifying aforementioned problems?I want to upgrade manually to Police Market from my old 2.3.4 but i cannot see .APK file of old market and cannot backup it. Maybe i should just backup old SDHC card with Android Market 2.3.4 and keep this one just in case but copy this one as well to newer SDHC card, update old Market from there to Police Market and in case something goes bad, i have backup of old SDHC card?
