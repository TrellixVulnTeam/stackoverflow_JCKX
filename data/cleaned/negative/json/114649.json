    "Body":"I have paid for an app on the Google Play store and I've downloaded it on a device (my Android smartphone). Now I have a tablet, should I pay again for the same app? Or will logging in with the same account allow me to download it to my tablet \"for free\"?Differently from question Can I use multiple Android devices with a single Google account? I'm more focused on app for which I've paid to download them, and not simply in app sync.Since if this is possible, could it be a cracking mechanism? Meaning if a \"buyer\" account become public (username & password) anybody can use it and download paied app for free.This could apply for example in a \"family\" environment for example, one accunt that pay for app and all people having the same account on their device.",
