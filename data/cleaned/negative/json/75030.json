After the updgrade, CoolReader and Astro File Manager are unable to delete files.  In fact, with Astro, the system popup appears with \"Deleting...\" and stays up until I cancel it.Only connecting to a PC with USB and opening the folders there has allowed me to delete files.Any suggestions on settings or anything else to correct this?Thanks!Bill",
