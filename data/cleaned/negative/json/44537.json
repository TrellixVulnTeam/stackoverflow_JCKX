    "Body":"My Note 2 battery is driving me insane.I have been using my Note 2 for like 2 months. And I had been following the recharging cycle where you only charge the battery when it reaches 5% or less and remove from socket when it reaches 100%. This method has been working real well for me. I used to get really good battery life. I would recharge it to 100 and remove from socket and keep it there. I might only start working with it after 2 hrs of idle time a nd the battery percentage would be like 98 which is pretty normal.But two days back when I had to go out I found my battery level at 24 % and since I had no other choice I had to recharge it for 10 mins. That's when the problem started. After coming back home the battery had pretty decent juice left in it and I left it idle. After an hour or two when I checked the phone it had already switched off. I was in shock and tried to switch it on but it didn't work. So I thought of charging it to 100. After almost 3 hrs it was fully charged but since I don't work on my phone so late in the night, I removed it from socket, switched it on and left it there idle. And when I woke up after 5 hrs it had only 69% juice left in my battery. I checked my running apps and there were none. I had my data connection stopped. And still only 69?Thats kinda weird right? Is it because I recharged it before getting to 5 %. Is there a way I can remove the battery cycle cache or something?",
