Another oddity: in older versions of swype, when you typed a non-English word, you were prompted to add it to your swype dictionary. Then, they changed this, such that all new words were automatically added to your dictionary. With this new v1.3.1.9274 version, however, swype seems to have gone back to the \"add to dictionary\" prompt.Any clue as to what may be going on?I'm using JB on my Galaxy Nexus.",
