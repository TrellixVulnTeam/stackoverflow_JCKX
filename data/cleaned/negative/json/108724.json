However, I did manage to gain root access. I can't seem to find a ROM compatible with the phone. Is there anywhere specific I could find one? Or am I just missing it? One of the apps I want to remove is required since I can't update my device otherwise, and I really want to remove all this. Any help would be appreciated. I'm currently running Android KitKat.",
