    "Body":"I have HTC Explorer, when I download a wallpaper from net and try to set it as wallpaper, the phone first asks me to crop it, so I crop it, but some portion from all the four sides of the cropped image is not displayed.And now the main problem, the phone has 320x480 screen resolution, I have a wallpaper from net with the same resolution, but the phone still asks me to crop it, while cropping most of the times I have to let go the image from top and bottom, the horizontal part of the image is available but vertical part needs to be cropped.More interestingly, I created a jpg file on ms paint on computer with 320x480 pix and transferred it to the phone, even then it asked me to crop it and after cropping when I saw the wallpaper to my surprise it was not what or how the original image was cropped.can you guys help me, thanx in advance.
