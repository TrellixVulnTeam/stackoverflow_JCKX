Before people start telling me to use Skype or GTalk, let me make it clear: 3G Video Call is a native value-added-service for video calls based on minutes rather than data plan. It is provided by operators in many countries (except US). Even many Samsung phones do have the 3G Video call option in their \"custom\" ROM in my country. But I am on a Nexus S and there is currently no built-in way I can use my video \"minutes\".  Is there any way to do this?",

But I am on a Nexus S and there is currently no way I can use my video \"minutes\". I am willing to fork CM to include the feature if I can get some ideas as to how to build it. So, any links or code repositories using talking about this would be insanely useful. And I am also sure that this feature would be extremely useful to many international users. Besides, I am willing to spend 3-4 months on building this."
