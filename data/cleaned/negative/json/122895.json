    "Body":"I have never worked on Android apps, so excuse my ignorance.I've managed to get my hands on a user\/game data file from a game (namely, CSR Racing) on Android. The file is gzip compressed, and when I decompress it it gives me a file with two pieces of info: the fist line is a 40-characters long string which looks like some sort of hash (SHA1 I'd assume from the length), and the second line is a JSON of game data like how much credit the user has, what level they're in.. etc. Now, when I try hashing the JSON data and compare the hash result with what they have in the first line, they don't match. So clearly it's not a simple method of hashing the data to check for corruption\/manipulations. How would you experienced lads go about analyzing what the first line is comprised of? I've also managed to get the source code of the app from .apk, but I cannot seem to locate where the check is done so I'd get an idea of how it's generated?Here's what the file contains:04e667013eefd34f403b0ca015b2b6761b0edb84{\"name\":\"user#######\",...data...}",
