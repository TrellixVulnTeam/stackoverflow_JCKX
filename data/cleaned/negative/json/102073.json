    "Body":"I've recently bought a magnetic cover for my tablet (a bamboo smart cover for Asus Transformer Pad TF303CL). What puzzles me is that whenever I open the cover, the screen turns on. How does the tablet know when I open the cover?The cover isn't connected in any way to the tablet, AFAIK. The only way that I could think of is if the tablet is using the light sensor, but then why doesn't it turn on the screen when I use my finger to cover the sensor? Or when I turn the light off and then on again?",
