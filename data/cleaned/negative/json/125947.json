    "Body":"I was using HTC Desire 626 which was connected to my Google account. I lost it yesterday, or may be it was stolen (pickpocket) while I was visiting a busy street market in Pratunam, Thailand.When I tried to call from other numbers within 1 hour it was already switched off. So I guess its with someone.I didnt have Google photo\/ sync. The phone was an anniversary gift from my wife. She bought it 14 days ago just before we went to Thailand on holidays. We had so many precious photos of our best memories there.Is there a way to retrieve data\/ images from that phone?Is there a way to track the phone?Any idea at all?",
