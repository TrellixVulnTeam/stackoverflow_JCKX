But what if, as a nasty joke, someone manages to grab a hold of your device and hits the magic power-home-volume key combination and proceeds to factory reset your device thus deleting your folder configuration, a record of what unpaid apps you had downloaded, and what is more, data stored on your phone!So, is there a way to set up a password so that it must be entered when such magic key combination is issued (so that you can't factory reset your device without entering such a \"BIOS\" password?Thanks!!!",
