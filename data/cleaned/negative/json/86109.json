    "Body":"So on my android tablet that I've had for about five months I'm getting an error in my notification bar that says storage space running out some system functions may not work. I don't know how to fix it. I first got this notification about a month ago and I managed to uninstall a bunch of apps and download clean master. It fixed the problem for a month. Then it did it again. So I used clean master and still it doesn't work. If I try to get a new app it says insufficient space on device or something like that. It won't let me download apps so don't tell me to download an app. I have downloaded many apps and had them on there at once. I uninstaled a bunch of them and it still won't let me download anything at all. Its not rooted so does any one happen to have a good you tube video or a good way that is fairly simple?",
