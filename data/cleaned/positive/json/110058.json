The problem is that my friend's phone (once again, identical circumstances) has updated to Lollipop but mine is stuck on version 4.4.2. His has been updated for over a week now. I've checked for updates multiple times lately and can't get the update. Is there something wrong with my phone or is it something I'm doing wrong because my friend had the update installed automatically but I can't get mine to update at all.PS my phone is NOT rooted and is in perfect physical condition with a stable connection to WiFi.",
