It's interesting to know from a users point of view (but I'm not asking which device is better, I'm also not doing market research, just interested in which android device has what market share from a users point of view. I'm also not going to use these statistics for marketing, shopping or legal reasons).I've googled for similar information from others, but it seems the only device market share information I can find is from specific applications which tends to skew the overall statistics (i.e. statistics for a phone signal application isn't going to be relevant to the majority of tablets).Anyone know of such a source of statistics?",
