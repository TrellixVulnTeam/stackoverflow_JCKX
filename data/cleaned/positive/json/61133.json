    "Body":"I had a Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.2.1 and it broke. My insurance replaced it, so I have a new Galaxy Nexus running Android 4.0.2. The new phone doesn't show that any system updates are available. (Well, I think it updated from 4.0.0 to 4.0.2 as soon as I turned it on, but nothing since then.) How do I update it to 4.2?(Sorry if I'm not giving enough information; I'm new and I'm not sure what's relevant.)QUESTION RESPONSES:-I am in Canada and my provider is Mobilicity.-I have tried going to About Phone -> System Updates and nothing shows up.  When I first got the phone, it updated from like 4.0.0 or 4.0.1 to 4.0.2, but that's all that has showed up.  I also tried clearing the cache and force stopping Google Services Framework, as suggested in another thread.-I don't really know what it means to install the update manually; I guess I'm willing to, but I feel that something must be wrong because this is the exact same phone (as far as I can tell) I've had for the last year with the exact same provider.  When I got this phone one year ago, it ran Jelly Bean automatically, so I don't get why this one wouldn't do the same automatically.NEW INFO:-Sometimes when I click System Updates, after it says there no updates available and shows \"Last checked for updates\" as the current time, it starts downloading a 41.2 MB \"Android System Update\".  After it downloads, it restarts and gets that picture of the robot having surgery, but it's still running 4.0.2.I don't think this question is a duplicate of the one posted, because this is a case where I know there is an official update from the carrier\/manufacturer, but my phone isn't seeing it.I noticed another thing: when it downloads the \"Android System Update\" and restarts, the picture of the robot starts off as a green guy standing up with a blue thing spinning in his chest, but then it changes to the green guy laying down with a red caution triangle over his chest.  Does that tell me anything?",
