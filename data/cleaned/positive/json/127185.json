I also will prefer answers discussing the questions from a positive, neutral and negative standpoint. (You may choose to answer the questions separately)To moderators, I asked both questions together as they are interrelated and then, there is the title to consider. Please do not flag this question or delete it, as it is in earnest (\"Is Android secure and if it isn't, what can Google do about it?\" for a very specific set of problems inviting only a very specific set of answers). This may, with proper edits, be made a community wiki post in the future if satisfactory answers are obtained.This is also specifically about Android. Anything like \"Android is for freedom\" and \"Go use iOS\" will be coming considered fanboyism and will be downvoted. We are serious here."
