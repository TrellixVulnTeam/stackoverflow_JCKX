Ideally, I'd like to remove this app but my fear is that if I do that it will bork the phone because it's been told to startup from somewhere else in the O/S.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My guess is that if the app was not set to start up automatically elsewhere in the O/S I could remove the app. To that end, is my assumption correct and where would the O/S maintain it's list of services to be started so that I could address this app once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;What's the app? It's called GPS Navigator and it seems to be created by Bell. It will not work unless you have a data plan and I tend to use the native Google mapping programs (as they do).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So it's not a necessary application by any means. It's just that the darn thing is set to run as a service and that precludes me from jusr arbitrarily using root explorer to remove it altogether. My specific concern is that if it's set to run as a service, and the program has been removed, then the phone may not start.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;How can I remove the auto-startup as a service for this evil app?&#10;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" ClosedDate="2012-10-03T23:16:37.967" CommentCount="0" CreationDate="2012-09-04T22:38:36.747" Id="28779" LastActivityDate="2013-01-31T16:12:56.857" LastEditDate="2013-01-31T16:12:56.857" LastEditorUserId="16575" OwnerUserId="18881" PostTypeId="1" Score="0" Tags="&lt;services&gt;" Title="Preventing Application Startup" ViewCount="375" />

The specific app isn't important to this question.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This app has no legitimate need to run in the background. I only need file management when I'm actively using the app. (In case my specific example does turn out to have a need, suppose for the sake of the discussion that it actually doesn't.)&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The fact that it runs in the background is confirmed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eolwral.osmonitor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;system monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Even though I believe that it has no legitimate need to run in the background and don't want it to do so, I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want to uninstall it.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Can I prevent such an app from running in the background?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;Practical application&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the need for this specific question, and why I'm not naming specific apps, consider what I had in mind when I wrote this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I would like to go through my apps and decide which ones I want to run as services. Some should run without restrictions. Some should never run. Some should only run when some set of conditions is met. Using the information from an answer to this question, I could implement this--possibly by some custom scripting, possibly using Tasker, or possibly using another approach. Trying to handle this via each individual app's settings would be well-nigh impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if what I'm asking in this question isn't possible, then this application of it isn't viable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;h1&gt;Notes based on the comments and answers&lt;/h1&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The reason why I want to do this is irrelevant. Perhaps it's to save battery. Perhaps it's another reason. This question is about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. A warning that a particular solution could have negative side-effects is useful if presented along with that solution. Saying, &quot;It's impossible&quot; is legitimate if true. Saying &quot;Don't do it&quot; isn't useful.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This is not a duplicate of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://android.stackexchange.com/q/1349/14562&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; I linked to in my first paragraph. That question was about saving memory. This one isn't. That one said, basically, &quot;Don't try.&quot; That's not a valid answer to this question.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The specific apps are unimportant, which is why I was vague. I did give a hint as to a specific example I had in mind, but I'm looking for a general answer here.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A solution must also prevent an app from automatically restarting; otherwise, it isn't much of a solution.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;A number of people have stated that this is a duplicate. Let me try to explain more clearly why it isn't:&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;This question is about how to prevent an app from running in the background, which includes stopping it from restarting if killed.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The answers so far have fallen into a few general categories:&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You shouldn't try, because doing so is unnecessary.&lt;/em&gt; I'm not disputing this point at this time, but &quot;You shouldn't try&quot; is very different from &quot;You can't.&quot; Logically, it's addressing a different question, namely &quot;Should I try to kill apps that I don't want to run?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use method X to kill the app.&lt;/em&gt; Unfortunately, when I tried said method, it didn't prevent the app from restarting, just like others predicted. So, it isn't really an answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ping the developer/it's a bug.&lt;/em&gt; This is the most useful of the suggested solutions, but my question was looking for a generic solution.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;The other questions that this question has been said to be a duplicate of cover the same ground as in my previous point. Thus, my specific question has &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; been addressed, despite many claims to the contrary. It's appearing, however, that the answer is a simple &quot;You can't&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;There's a related question on meta. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.android.stackexchange.com/a/347/14562&quot;&gt;Jeff Atwood's answer&lt;/a&gt;, he says in part, &quot;It's generally sufficient to link to the other question and explain why it doesn't meet your needs.&quot; The whole thread is apropos to this question.

Those are said to be stored as 32bit and since &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; takes away the value &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, there should be the &lt;code&gt;4,294,967,295&lt;/code&gt; other unique ids, and hence &quot;slots&quot; for apps, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this answer is to seek a response either confirm or refute the suggestion I made, i.e. that apps and &lt;code&gt;UIDs&lt;/code&gt; relate?   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Potentially this could be Android Version dependent, as I expect that &lt;code&gt;selinux&lt;/code&gt; might be able to help &lt;code&gt;sandboxing&lt;/code&gt; without using the &quot;only 32bit&quot; UID limitation, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" ClosedDate="2016-02-25T08:03:24.817" CommentCount="0" CreationDate="2016-02-25T07:39:06.767" Id="138061" LastActivityDate="2016-02-25T08:03:19.783" OwnerUserId="152874" PostTypeId="1" Score="0" Tags="&lt;security&gt;&lt;permissions&gt;&lt;selinux&gt;" Title="Is 4,294,967,295 the conceptual limit of apps installable to a android device?"

  <row AnswerCount="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;I am looking into Google authentication (&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/&lt;/a&gt;)&#10;Is it possible to launch the same activity (via the Auth.GoogleSignInApi.getSignInIntent) from a browser as you do from a mobile app?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If you use a browser to use google sign-in then you will automatically use the web application (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/&lt;/a&gt;). But I would like to use the mobile application when users are going to my website from a mobile browser on Android.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I know it's possible to launch Intents from the Android browser but I'm unsure if it is also possible to launch the google sign-in intent AND have the reply returned to a webpage (a callback webpage if you will).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;So let's split this up in two parts:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;ul&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to launch the google sign-in activity?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to get the reply from such an activity delivered to a web application?&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Roel&lt;/p&gt;&#10;" ClosedDate="2016-03-01T21:24:19.777" CommentCount="1" CreationDate="2016-03-01T15:41:49.660" Id="138538" LastActivityDate="2016-03-01T21:24:02.823" OwnerUserId="154064" PostTypeId="1" Score="-1" Tags="&lt;browser&gt;&lt;google&gt;&lt;intents&gt;" Title="How to launch com.google.android.gms.auth.GOOGLE_SIGN_IN from Android browser" ViewCount="11" />
